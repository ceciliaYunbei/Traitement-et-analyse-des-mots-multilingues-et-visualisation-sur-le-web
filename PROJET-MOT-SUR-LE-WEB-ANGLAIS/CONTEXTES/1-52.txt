Family Leave Needs To Be Bigger, Broader, And Gayer
   But that was a long time ago when a family could live off of one
   It was also when gay families and the LGBT community in general were
   But the times are changing. And family leave needs to catch up.
   But as I get older, I see my friends and family members having children
   chosen family members.
   The Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) was signed to “help working
   parents and other caregivers balance work and family.” Of course, its
   definition of “family” is very narrow, and although last summer’s
   means to be “family.” Many of us have been rejected by our biological
   cases, these chosen family members love us more than our blood
   Yet if my friend, who I define as family, falls ill and has no one else
   And the issue of expanding the definition of “family” isn’t just a gay
   family and medical leave. It affects us, it affects our loved ones, and
   who will work to expand the legal definitions of family within the FMLA
   lives and the families of every worker, whether they are the CEO of a
   kitchen all day. Family leave shouldn’t just be for white-collar
   on their table deserves paid family and medical leave.
