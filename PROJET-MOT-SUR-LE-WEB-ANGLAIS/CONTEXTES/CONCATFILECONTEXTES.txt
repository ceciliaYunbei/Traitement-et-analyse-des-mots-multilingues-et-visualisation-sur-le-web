   family
   'Family' is a single word, with many different meanings. People have
   many ways of defining a family and what being a part of a family means
   to them. Families differ in terms of economic, cultural, social, and
   many other facets, but what every family has in common is that the
   people who call it a family are making clear that those people are
   important in some way to the person calling them his family.
Definition of Family
   The dictionary defines family in several ways. One definition is "a

Redefining Family
   Rather than simply defining family by a dictionary definition, each
   individual should look to define a family by his own standards,
   enriching the dictionary's definition. You can have several families in

   of how you choose to define your family unit, whether it is traditional
   or unique, your definition is of the family unit that works for you. As
