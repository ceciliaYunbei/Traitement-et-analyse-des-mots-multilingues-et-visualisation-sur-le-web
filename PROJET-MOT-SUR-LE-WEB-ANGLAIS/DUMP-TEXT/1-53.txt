New York State Expands Definition of Parent

   If you've helped raise a child, you can seek custody and visitation
   rights even if you aren't related by law or biology, the state's
   highest court rules.

   New York State may pride itself on being in the forefront of progress
   on many social issues — it was an early adopter of marriage equality,
   for instance — but it’s just now catching up to most other states in
   expanding the definition of parenthood.

   The New York State Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, ruled
   Tuesday that “a caretaker who is not related to, or the adoptive
   guardian of, a child could still be permitted to ask for custody and
   visitation rights,” The New York Times reports.

   The ruling, which involved a same-sex couple, is important to all types
   of families and brings New York in line with most of the states in the
   nation, including some very conservative ones, which allow these “de
   facto parents,” as the Times puts it, to seek custody and visitation
   rights.

   The judges ruled in a dispute between women identified in court papers
   only as Brooke S.B. and Elizabeth A. C.C. They entered into a
   relationship in 2006 but did not marry, as New York did not allow
   same-sex marriages at the time, and they could not afford to travel to
   a state that did. Elizabeth became pregnant through alternative
   insemination in 2008 and gave birth to a son the following year.

   “Though Brooke had no legal or biological ties to the child, a boy, she
   maintained a close relationship with him for years, cutting his
   umbilical cord at birth, giving him her last name and raising him
   jointly with Elizabeth,” the Times reports. The couple split up in
   2010, but Brooke continued to be a parent to him, according to Lambda
   Legal, which was part of her legal team in the case. In 2013, Elizabeth
   cut Brooke off from contact with the boy, leading Brooke to sue for
   custody and visitation.

   A family court dismissed her case, and an appellate court agreed, both
   saying they had to follow the precedent set by a 1991 Court of Appeals
   ruling in a case known as Alison D., which held that “nonbiological,
   nonmarried, nonadoptive parents are legal strangers to the children
   they raised with a same-sex partner,” Susan Sommer, Lambda Legal’s
   national director of constitutional litigation, explained in a press
   release.

   But in ruling on the new case, the Court of Appeals recognized that the
   understandings of marriage and family have evolved since 1991. “The
   definition of ‘parent’ established by this court 25 years ago in Alison
   D. has become unworkable when applied to increasingly varied familial
   relationships,” Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam wrote for the court majority.

   She further noted, “Alison D.’s foundational premise of heterosexual
   parenting and nonrecognition of same-sex couples is unsustainable,”
   especially in light of the marriage equality law New York State passed
   in 2011 and the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that brought equal
   marriage rights to all 50 states.

   “Where a partner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the
   parties agreed to conceive a child and to raise the child together, the
   nonbiological, nonadoptive partner has standing to seek visitation and
   custody,” Abdus-Salaam added.

   “We are extremely gratified that Brooke will finally have her day in
   court to establish that she is the parent of the son she cherishes,”
   Sommer said. We are eager for them to be reunited as soon as possible.”

   The ruling also applies in a similar case, Estrellita A. v. Jennifer
   L.D., which involved similar issues, Lambda Legal notes. In this case a
   lesbian nonbiological parent who was ordered to pay child support
   argued that she should be able to petition for custody and visitation
   rights.

   The decision puts New York on the same page as many other states, even
   conservative ones like Oklahoma and South Carolina, the Times notes.
   “Many courts have simply said that this person looks like a parent and
   you cannot just eliminate them from the child’s life,” Nancy D.
   Polikoff, a professor at the American University Washington College of
   Law, told the paper. “To have New York, where there are so many
   same-sex couples, be an outlier was a problem. But this catches New
   York up.”
