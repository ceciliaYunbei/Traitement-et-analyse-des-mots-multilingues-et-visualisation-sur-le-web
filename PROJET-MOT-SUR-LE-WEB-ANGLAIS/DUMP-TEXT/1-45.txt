   The definition of family and domestic violence will be broadened to
   include emotional, psychological and economic abuse under new laws in
   the ACT.

   The new legislation, introduced to the ACT Legislative Assembly on
   Tuesday, also aims to strengthen protections for victims of domestic,
   family and sexual violence, and improve access to legal responses by
   reforming the ACT's legal framework.

   The definition of family and domestic violence will be broadened to
   include emotional, psychological and economic abuse ... The definition
   of family and domestic violence will be broadened to include emotional,
   psychological and economic abuse under new laws in the ACT.

   Attorney-General Simon Corbell said responses to domestic and family
   violence have traditionally focused on physical forms of violence.

   "These important reforms emphasise non-physical forms of violence and
   emphasise that in the ACT, family violence is unacceptable in any
   form," he said.

   "While gender-based violence, including domestic violence, cannot be
   eliminated through law reform alone, legal measures are an essential
   component of any response to domestic and family violence."

   The new legislation also:

     * amends the grounds for making a final protection order, and
       after-hours order, to improve access to the scheme.
     * introduces provisions to prevent self-represented respondents from
       cross-examining applicants themselves.
     * makes amendments to allow the complainant's pre-recorded evidence
       to be tendered as evidence-in-chief in all sexual assault matters.
     * implements the scheme for national recognition of family violence
       orders as agreed by the Council of Australian Governments.
     * introduces a preamble that speaks to the nature and features of
       family violence.

   Mr Corbell said the legal process could be an "emotional and difficult"
   time for victims of family, domestic or sexual violence, and the
   legislation would provide additional protections for them.

   "Implementation of these reforms ensures the ACT's justice response to
   family violence is in step with other jurisdictions and recognised best
   practice," he said.

   The reforms implement 22 recommendations made by the Australian and New
   South Wales Law Reform Commissions in their report Family Violence â€“ a
   National Legal Response.

   The government's reforms align with the Second Implementation Plan for
   the ACT's Prevention Against Women and Children Strategy 2011-2017.

   The Legislative Assembly also passed new laws allowing the ACT Civil
   and Administrative Tribunal to hear civil dispute claims of up to
   $25,000 on Tuesday - increasing the current $10,000 maximum.

   Mr Corbell said the amendments would allow Canberrans to obtain an
   inexpensive remedy for low-level civil claims under $25,000, including
   everyday consumer disputes, such as motor vehicle transactions, minor
   home renovations, and landscaping contracts.

   The legislation also combines the functions of the ACAT's general
   president and appeal president into one role of president who will have
   to be a magistrate or eligible for appointment as a magistrate.

   "These changes ensure the ACAT is appropriately resourced and ready to
   undertake its functions for many years into the future for the benefit
   of the ACT community," Mr Corbell said
