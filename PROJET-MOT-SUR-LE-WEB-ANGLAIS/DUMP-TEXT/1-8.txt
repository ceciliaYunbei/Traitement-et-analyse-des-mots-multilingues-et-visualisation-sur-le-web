Embracing A More Realistic And Inclusive Definition Of Family

   Who makes up a family?

   For most Americans today, family includes a range of loved ones--from
   children, parents and grandparents to spouses, significant others,
   siblings and close friends. However, the most prevalent family
   definitions in law and policy leave out many of these important
   relationships. All too often, policymakers define family narrowly,
   based on an outdated 1950s conception of a married husband and wife and
   their biological children. Fortunately, recent paid sick days victories
   in Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Chicago, as well as executive action by
   the White House, embrace a more realistic and inclusive definition.

   According to the U.S. Census, nearly 80 percent of households in the
   U.S. depart from the "nuclear family" model of a married husband and
   wife and their children. Many family trends contribute to this fact.
   For example, approximately 57 million individuals in the U.S. live in
   multigenerational households, double the 1980 figure, and about 20
   percent of households with children include non-relatives or extended
   family. Americans are also waiting longer to marry and are living with
   significant others at higher rates than in past decades. And surveys
   show that LGBTQ individuals, who are too often forced to leave home and
   build their own support networks, are more likely to rely on close
   friends for emotional support, caregiving needs and help in an
   emergency.

   This month, the country's second and third most populous cities took a
   big step forward in recognizing that families come in all shapes and
   sizes. Beginning on July 1, 2016, workers in Los Angeles will be
   entitled to earn a minimum number of paid sick days that can be used to
   care for personal or family health and safety needs. Workers in Chicago
   will gain this same right on July 1, 2017. The L.A. and Chicago paid
   sick days laws both cover a broad set of family relationships,
   including children, parents, spouses, domestic partners, parents of a
   spouse or domestic partner, grandparents, grandchildren and siblings.
   Yet both laws also set an important new standard for the growing paid
   sick days movement by including "chosen family"-- an individual with
   whom the worker has such a close relationship that the individual is
   equivalent to family, even absent a blood or legal relationship.

   These new laws will have enormous practical benefits for workers. For
   example, a 2007 Los Angeles County Health Survey found that 1.2 million
   residents in L.A. County provide informal, unpaid care to aging, ill or
   disabled adults. Of these caregivers, more than 23 percent -- or
   approximately 284,000 people -- reported that they provide care for
   close friends or extended family members (family members other than a
   child, parent, parent-in-law, spouse, domestic partner, grandparent or
   sibling). Many of these caregivers struggle to combine their work
   responsibilities with the need to care for loved ones, and
   employer-provided leave policies, when they exist at all, often fail to
   recognize these extended and chosen family members. The L.A. paid sick
   days coalition raised awareness about this need and worked with
   lawmakers to pass a paid sick days law that reflects the true nature of
   family and caregiving relationships in the city.

   Fortunately, we have a long-standing model for this definition. Our
   country's largest employer, the federal government, already allows more
   than 2 million federal employees to use paid leave to care for chosen
   family. The government's broad family definition has existed in
   personnel rules for more than five decades, and has repeatedly been
   expanded and applied more broadly without issue. The model is also
   being adopted in other contexts, including a presidential Executive
   Order that will guarantee paid sick days to employees of federal
   contractors. And last month, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House of
   Representatives to expand the FMLA's limited family definition to
   include new relationships, including chosen family.

   Other places are modernizing their family definition as well.
   Minneapolis recently passed a paid sick days law that is the first in
   the country to cover all members of the employee's household. When sick
   or during a medical emergency, we often seek care from those who are
   both emotionally and physically closest to us. Roommates, significant
   others, and additional members of the household -- whether extended
   relatives or close friends -- provide a critical care and support
   system. Minneapolis' new paid sick time law acknowledges the importance
   of these relationships.

   We are fortunate to work with national, state and local partners across
   the country who are fighting for policy change, collecting stories, and
   raising awareness about the need to expand family recognition. From
   Oregon, Montana and Arizona to New Mexico and Washington D.C., social
   justice advocates are pushing lawmakers to adopt broad family
   definitions that include chosen family. Cities as diverse as L.A.,
   Minneapolis and Chicago have recognized that families today are
   incredibly varied and dynamic. It's time for other cities and states to
   follow their lead.

   social justice movements to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ workers
   and expand family definitions in law and policy.
