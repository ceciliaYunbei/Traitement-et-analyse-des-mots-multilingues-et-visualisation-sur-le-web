   News about Britain

   Modern British Families

                                                           Mother and kids

   Listen Listen to the story

   Father leaves for work in the morning after breakfast. The two children
   take the bus to school, and mother stays at home cooking and cleaning
   until father and the kids return home in the evening. This is the
   traditional picture of a happy family living in Britain. But is it true
   today? The answer is - no! The past 20 years have seen enormous changes
   in the lives and structures of families in Britain, and the traditional
   model is no longer true in many cases.

   The biggest change has been caused by divorce. As many as 2 out of 3
   marriages now end in divorce, leading to a situation where many
   children live with one parent and only see the other at weekends or
   holidays.

   There has also been a huge rise in the number of mothers who work. The
   large rise in divorces has meant many women need to work to support
   themselves and their children. Even when there is no divorce, many
   families need both parents to work in order to survive. This has caused
   an increase in childcare facilities, though they are very expensive and
   can be difficult to find in many areas. In addition, women are no
   longer happy to stay at home raising children, and many have careers
   earning as much as or even more than men, the traditional breadwinners.

   There has also been a sharp increase in the number of single mothers,
   particularly among teenagers. Many of their children grow up never
   knowing their fathers, and some people feel the lack of a male role
   model has a damaging effect on their lives.

   However, these changes have not had a totally negative effect. For
   women, it is now much easier to have a career and good salary. Although
   it is difficult to be a working mother, it has become normal and it's
   no longer seen as a bad thing for the children. As for children
   themselves, some argue that modern children grow up to be more
   independent and mature than in the past. From an early age they have to
   go to childminders or nurseries, and so they are used to dealing with
   strangers and mixing with other children.

   So while the traditional model of a family may no longer be true in
   modern Britain, the modern family continues to raise happy, successful
   children.
