Toyota's new 'cuddly' robot could expand the definition of family

The Kirobo Mini can recognize expressions and make conversation.

   The folks at Toyota recently released a new robot, but before you turn
   away, know this: this robot isn't like others you've seen. The Japanese
   automaker's new robot aims to fill a different void — providing
   companionship and connection to those who need it.

   The Kirobo Mini (kirobo is a combination of the Japanese words for hope
   and robot) is a doe-eyed robot that can fit in the palm of your hand.
   The little robot includes a camera, microphone and Bluetooth
   connection, and it uses these features to recognize facial expressions
   and participate in unscripted conversations. You can see it in action
   in this short video:

   In Japan, where birth rates are plummeting and the population is aging,
   Toyota is hoping the Kirobo Mini will make a connection with anyone who
   is feeling lonely.

   "He wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which
   hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself," said Fuminori
   Kataoka, Kirobo Mini's chief design engineer. "This vulnerability is
   meant to invoke an emotional connection."

   Kirobo Mini also emulates a child by blinking its large eyes and
   speaking in a high-pitched, baby-like voice. It even comes with a
   "cradle" that looks like a baby bunting and doubles as a car seat by
   fitting into cup holders.

   The Kirobo Mini will go on sale at Toyota dealerships in Japan next
   year for 39,800 yen (about $392 in U.S. dollars). Its designers see the
   robot as a bridge toward helping people become more accustomed to
   accepting robots in their daily lives.

   Japan's aging workforce and reluctance to allow immigrant employees add
   up to a diminished number of available workers to fill job vacancies.
   Last year, Japan opened its first robot-staffed hotel and plans are
   underway to integrate robots into stores and banks across the country.
   It's even likely that robots like the Kirobo Mini will connect (some
   day) with self-driving car technology.

   But for now, the Kirobo Mini has but one task — to chat, cuddle and
   provide companionship — just like any other member of the family.
