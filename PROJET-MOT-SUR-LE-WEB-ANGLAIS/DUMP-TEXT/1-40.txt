   Protesters say the group spreads a message of exclusion and

   About 50 protesters braved the rain Thursday night to demonstrate
   against the ninth World Congress of Families and its definition of
   family.

   The demonstrators — who marched outside the Grand America Hotel, where
   the organization is meeting this week — carried signs that read "WFC
   Spreads Hate Not Truth," "Love Makes a Family" and "Don't Diss Adoptive
   Parents."

   The World Congress of Families promotes "the natural family" of a
   married mother and father and their children, and it says it works to
   strengthen all families.

   But critics say the organization hurts families and supports laws in
   other countries that criminalize homosexuality. Restore Our Humanity,
   which organized Thursday's demonstration, says it strongly opposes the
   WCF message of exclusion and divisiveness.

   And the Southern Poverty Law Center has declared the World Congress of
   Families to be a "hate group" for fostering homophobia under the guise
   of protecting families.

   WCF officials reject the hate-group allegation and say they are "not
   'anti' anything."

   Demonstrator Mary Vaughan said she is disappointed that some of Utah's
   leaders, including Gov. Gary Herbert, spoke at the conference.

   Mark Lawrence, director of Restore Our Humanity, which works to further
   human rights in Utah, also objected to the governor's appearance and
   said he is going to work against Herbert's re-election.

   Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, who spoke at the
   demonstration, questioned how anyone could support the World Congress
   of Families. He said the group incites the fear of persecution.

   "This is not about family," Gill said. "This is about tearing families
   apart."
