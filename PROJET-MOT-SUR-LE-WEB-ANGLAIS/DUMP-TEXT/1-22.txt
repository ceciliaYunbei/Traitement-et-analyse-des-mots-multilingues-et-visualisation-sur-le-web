What is the “Traditional American Family?”

   Traditional1-580x490 Pin It
   Posted By: Laurel Moglen

   An interview with Stephanie Coontz
   What is the “traditional family?”  Working father, stay-at-home mom,
   and two kids? In this day and age, so few families fit that
   description, it’s basically a ridiculous notion. As the Holidays
   approach, we’re very interested in learning more about what today’s
   families really look like, and how it’s affecting our kids.  At what
   point will the vision of what makes the “Traditional American Family”
   be altered to reflect our new realities?  We got a welcomed reality
   check from Stephanie Coontz, esteemed author and Director of Research
   and Public Education for the Council on Contemporary Families. We want
   to know:  who sits at your holiday table?  And more importantly, who’s
   making dinner?  — Sam Kurtzman-Counter, President, TMC

   What is the most current percentage of American families that fit into
   the “traditional” category – that is working dad, stay-at-home mom, and
   kid/s?

   New census figures show that as of 2011, only 23% of married couple
   families with children younger than age 15 have a stay-at-home mother
   (SAHM).  These days, there are more kids being raised by single moms
   than by married couples where the man earns all the income and the wife
   stays home.

   What are the stats of gay, lesbian, stay-at-home-dads, and other
   “non-traditional” families?

   Married couples with children account for less than a quarter of all
   households. More than 30 percent of households are single person
   households. 23 percent of children live with a single mother, 5 percent
   with a single father. More than 70 percent of all children live in
   families where every adult in the household is employed.
   Stay-at-home-dads are still a small minority — less than a million in
   the country –but dads do the primary child care for more than a quarter
   of the children whose mother works outside the home.

   According to revised estimates from the 2010 census, there are 131,729
   same-sex married couple households and 514,735 same-sex unmarried
   partner households in the united states, but this relies on
   self-reports, so is biased toward the low side. About 20 percent of
   same sex couples are raising kids.

   What are the myths about the “Traditional American Family’?

   One myth is that male breadwinner families were “the” traditional
   family. Much more traditional has been the custom of having a family
   labor force — either with the wife as co-provider or the children, and
   often both. It was not until the 1920s that a bare majority of kids
   grew up in a family where the mother was not working on the farm or in
   a small business, and where the children were in school instead of in
   the workforce. That family form receded in the Depression and World War
   II and came roaring back in the 1950s, largely due to a combination of
   discrimination against female workers and unprecedented rises in real
   wages for young men, as home prices fell in the postwar boom, wages
   rose, and government invested in new jobs, job training, and
   educational opportunities. Most researchers agree that it will never
   come back as the majority family form.

   Another myth is that parents used to spend more time with their
   children in the 1950s and 1960s. While the hours moms spent looking
   after their children did initially fall as women entered the workforce,
   they started to rise again after 1980, so that today, parents spend
   more time with their kids than in 1965. (In 1965, kids spent more time
   with siblings and friends or just playing, watching tv in their rooms,
   and less in direct contact with mom than today, even though moms were
   often around more.) Working moms today spend somewhat less time
   interacting with their kids than SAHMs, but they spend more time with
   their kids than SAHMs did in 1965, the high point of male breadwinner
   families.

   Meanwhile, dads’ time with kids has quadrupled, and husbands of working
   moms spend more time with their children than husbands of SAHMs.

   Yet another myth is that there is this deep divide between what SAHMs
   and employed moms want. While a majority of employed moms would like to
   cut back their work hours, 40 percent of SAHMs wish they had a job. And
   when moms “opt out,” this is very often not their first choice, but
   their fallback when their employers won’t adjust hours or policies or
   their husband won’t or can’t lessen his hours enough to pitch in at
   home. Most women would like more balance in their work and family
   options, and so would most dads. In fact, unlike 35 years ago, men now
   report higher levels of work-family conflict than do women.

   How are young children (ages 3-6) affected by their non-traditional
   families?

   How a family functions is more important than how it looks from the
   outside. For example, statistics say that the best predictor of a
   child’s academic success is the mother’s education and aspirations for
   her child, not her marital state. A new study finds that on average,
   kids who have SAHMs during the first year of life have some small
   advantages over those who have working moms, but the reverse is true
   for those whose moms work during years 2 and 3 — and ultimately, most
   of the differences average out over the next 5 or 6 years. The big risk
   to kids is moms’ depression, and a study shows  — this is a win-win
   situation, somewhat like the fact that the more you nurse, the more
   your breast milk comes on — that moms are least depressed when they are
   doing what they want.

   For example, another recent study shows that the highest rates of
   depression are found in SAHMs who wish they had a job and in employed
   moms who want to stay home but have to work, and have only been able to
   find work in a low quality job. Interestingly, moms who want to stay
   home but have a high quality job have just about as low rates of
   depression as moms who are getting their first choice. Which suggests
   that SAHMs should be sure to keep their social networks and skills up
   so if they do want or need to go to work, they can get a job that gives
   them more control over their work and more flexibility.

   It’s very important for parents not to let themselves be tyrannized by
   averages. There is tremendous variability in outcomes, and parents have
   to find what arrangements suit both their individual needs and the
   dynamics of their family life. That said, children do better, whatever
   their parents’ working arrangements, when parents have access to
   parental leaves, well-funded and carefully regulated child care, and
   work-family benefits. And the U.S. lags behind every other rich country
   in the world in these matters.

   Is there any indication that the “traditional family” form is more or
   less stable than the “non-traditional” family?

   Again, variations in functioning and background count for more than the
   specific form. The most stable families are those with college-educated
   parents, whoever works. But women with higher education are LESS
   likely, not more likely, to opt out of the labor force. In heterosexual
   couples, the important predictor of marital stability is how fair the
   woman perceives the division of housework and childcare to be. (And a
   word to the wise for men: Women feel more intimate and more sexually
   attracted to their husbands when their husbands do housework and child
   care — there’s another win-win proposition.) Another factor is the age
   at first marriage. For every year a woman postpones marriage, right up
   to her early 30s, her chance of divorce goes down.

   Why is the image of the traditional family (working dad, SAHM, and kids
   under 18) so entrenched in the American consciousness?

   The breadwinner family of the 1950s was in fact a very new — and
   short-lived — invention. But it coincided with the development of
   television, and those images were burned into our consciousness. Also,
   most of the political and economic leaders in America, until recently,
   were products of that generation. They assumed that was the norm and
   that’s what they taught their own children. They designed their work
   and social policies around that assumption, and idealized that family
   form in the mass culture.

   How long will it last? I do think people are much more accepting of
   diversity than even 20 years ago, but our work policies, social
   programs, and even school schedules have been designed in ways that
   assume every working American has someone at home to take care of the
   rest of life, so a lot of economic and political leaders are in denial.
   Fearing it would be expensive and troublesome to adjust to the complex
   realities of family life today, they ask the rest of us to adjust to
   their simplistic fantasies about family life.
