   Premier Kathleen Wynne pledged on Tuesday to update a law in Ontario
   that forces some parents to adopt their own children.

   Currently, many couples — particularly those in lesbian relationships —
   discover only after their child is born that their birth certificate
   may not be as binding as they thought. That’s because provincial laws,
   as written, state only a birth mother and her live-in male partner or a
   biological male father are immediately recognized as parents.

   “Ontario’s laws are outdated and do not reflect our views on who can
   form a family,” Wynne said, adding she’s “committed to fixing this.”

   For decades, that gap has forced many couples to adopt their own
   children — mostly lesbian mothers, simply because their partners were
   the ones who carried the baby. Because surrogacy has its own complex
   set of rules, couples who use a surrogate aren’t caught up in the same
   legal limbo, and instead have parenting agreements worked out before
   birth. Straight couples who use an egg or sperm donor whom they know
   could also be affected by the outdated law, experts have said.

   It’s a costly and emotionally draining process that led a group of LGBT
   advocates to launch in April an ongoing Charter challenge against the
   government. It alleges the current law unfairly discriminates against
   lesbian couples, families with more than two parents involved and trans
   men who give birth and don’t want to be identified on the birth
   certificate as a mother.

   NDP MPP Cheri DiNovo first tabled a bill to end the legal uncertainty
   last October. She accused the government of “dithering” on the file and
   said they should just pass her bill instead of waiting until the fall.

   Wynne thanked her for her efforts and pledged to do just that by the
   end of 2016.

   However, government members say they need to table their own
   legislation, as their analysis requires some tweaks to DiNovo’s bill.
   With the house set to rise June 9, that bill won’t be introduced until
   September. Wynne said this is, in part, to ensure it complies with
   efforts to harmonize laws across the country.

   But Cy and Ruby’s Act — which is what DiNovo dubbed her bill in honour
   of two kids whose mothers had to adopt them because of the outdated law
   — is modelled after B.C.’s bill. DiNovo said Ontario is actually
   lagging on this, given four other provinces have already updated their
   laws.

   “Everyday that they dither on this, everyday there are other families
   going and having babies that do not have equal rights,” she said.
   “There should be some sense of urgency on this on the government’s
   part… I don’t understand the delay.”

   “I want to see this definition changed in Ontario by the end of the
   year,” Wynne said, a day before she’ll raise the flag to launch
   Toronto’s month-long LGBT Pride festival. A protest calling on her to
   update the law was scheduled before she made the

   She spoke during an event to formally open Egale Canada’s new Toronto
   shelter, the first of its kind to offer temporary and transitional
   housing as well as mental health and addiction support specifically to
   LGBT youth. The province committed $1.5 million over three years to
   facilitate Egale’s work as an LGBT advocacy and support organization.
