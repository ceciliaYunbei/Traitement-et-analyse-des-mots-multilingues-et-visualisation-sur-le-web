   Stump speeches and commentary still discuss family as something akin to

   When the US supreme court enshrined same-sex marriage as an inalienable
   civil right last month, justices managed to both expand and cement a
   traditional notion of “family”. It expanded because now two men or two
   women could marry and make a family – but that reiterates the very
   conservative notion that marriage is the linchpin of the family unit.

   For many, marriage is the symbolic cornerstone to the definition of
   family, and I’m ecstatic that whomever wishes to marry will never be
   constitutionally prohibited from doing so. But I’d also like to
   acknowledge that marriage isn’t always what every person desires or
   achieves. And family, as a concept, isn’t fixed to marriage. It is a
   fluid relationship of intimacies between communities that aren’t always
   confined to blood.

   In the US, families are increasingly “more ethnically, racially,
   religiously and stylistically diverse than half a generation ago,”
   according to a 2013 New York Times story about the shift. Family
   compositions now include “good friends [who] join forces as part of the
   ‘voluntary kin’ movement, sharing medical directives, wills, even
   adopting one another legally” or “single people live alone and proudly
   consider themselves families of one — more generous and civic-minded
   than so-called ‘greedy marrieds.’”

   Political discourse appears to lag behind this lived reality. Stump
   speeches and commentary still feature something akin to looking at the
   country through soft-focused, sepia-toned glasses of 1950s sitcoms. But
   I’m no longer willing to accept any presidential candidate or current
   sitting president repeating a narrative of absenteeism and
   condescension. Let’s retire that calcified thinking and language.

   I’m looking at you, President Obama. Too often, he returns to the
   narrative of black father absenteeism, using traditional families as
   the touchstone for what counts as good. It makes my teeth itch; though
   there is undoubtedly a small subset of children (not only of color) who
   are harmed by absent dads, they are a very particular category of
   at-risk youth that doesn’t reflect the black population writ large. And
   when he condescends to black audiences in churches or college
   commencement addresses promulgating that canard, he is also indirectly
   devaluing other family compositions. Republicans hoping to succeed him
   also fail to value “unconventional” families.

   Intergenerational households and singles count too in creating
   stability for children, and a father in the home isn’t always a
   guarantee of a child’s success in the face of stagnant wages or
   outright theft of working poor people. A father in the home is no balm
   for hyper-segregated communities starved of goods and services. A
   father in the home is no salve for a crumbling infrastructure and
   pitiful public transportation networks for women and men seeking
   sustainable employment so far out of their communities or for children
   commuting to decent schools. A father in the home doesn’t stop a wave
   of public school closures. It also bespeaks of a very patriarchal way
   of thinking about family (and an untrue one; according to a 2013 report
   from the US Department of Health and Human Services, black fathers are
   deeply involved in parenting their kids).

   Candidate Hillary Clinton seemed to intimate a more nuanced framing of
   the concerns of the new American family, adapting a language that
   tipped toward an inclusive and fluid definition of family in the
   American body politic. “[I]t is way past time to end the outrage of so
   many women still earning less than men on the job — and women of color
   often making even less. This isn’t a women’s issue. It’s a family
   issue,” she said:

   Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding
   childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family
   issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping
   more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a
   family issue. In America, every family should feel like they belong.

   Clinton is right. We should recognize that family isn’t defined by
   marriage or children, or by how many people comprises the unit. This
   isn’t an argument against family structure, but a challenge to those
   who hope to run the country to expand their rhetoric, push the
   definition of traditional family structure as man, woman and child. We
   exist in community. We already act accordingly, and our leaders should
   speak that way, too.
