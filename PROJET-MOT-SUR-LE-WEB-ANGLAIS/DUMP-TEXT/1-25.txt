You can’t choose your family – or your children’s friends

   The only sane response to having to be around people you can’t avoid is
   to get your own back

   Children at a sleepover in a makeshift tent

   It is often said, and truly, that you can’t choose your family. But the
   lack of choice in a parent’s life goes much further than this. Once you
   have children forming their own extra-familial relationships, you enter
   into a community of people that you can’t avoid. Only you don’t have
   the blood bonds that somehow keep family together (if you’re lucky).
   Inevitably, you are not going to like all of that imposed community.
   The chances are, you could cheerfully throttle some of them.

   With annoying or dislikable kids some recourse is available when they
   are in your home and in your power – ideally using tactics that they
   won’t be able to plausibly squeal about to their parents. You could try
   subtly undermining their self-esteem (“Do you really feel you need to
   have that pudding, dear? It’s very calorific”) or being wilfully
   unfair, perhaps by making sure that their choice of DVD never prevails
   (“Frozen is scratched I’m afraid … but this classic black and white
   documentary on the native wildlife of East Anglia is box fresh”).

   Such shameful – but entirely understandable – malice is particularly
   tempting when experiencing that modern horror, the sleepover. Here, you
   find out the true cost of hospitality when, at 1am, little Scheherazade
   or Cordelia is still cackling at the top of her voice while spreading
   the remnants of an illicit and adhesive midnight feast across the
   bedclothes and keeping your own children from sleeping so they will be
   thoroughly ill-tempered all through the next day.

     The parents can present a bigger problem. Let’s assume that the
     parents of little Crispin are card-carrying fascists …

   As payback, try a little casual cruelty when they show you their
   half-witted drawing of a pony, loudly admiring it before listlessly
   chucking it in the bin, or pointedly offering the dog one of the
   cookies they just made and pressed on you with their own dear little
   hands (ideally, you will have trained the dog to refuse it).

   The parents can present a bigger problem. Let’s assume, for instance,
   that the parents of little Crispin are card-carrying fascists. Very few
   people are quite so theatrically evil nowadays, so just say they swear
   by the Daily Express and have a signed photo of Nigel Farage on their
   mantelpiece.

   You have to sit around at their houses, perhaps when coming to pick up
   the children, while they make lots of veiled yet surly references to
   hijabs and “so-called refugees”. Or the problem may not be the tiresome
   opinions of the parents. It may be their behaviour that is problematic.
   A family with an admirable belief system may nevertheless smoke
   relentlessly inside the house or let the kids have access to
   age-inappropriate viewing material, or have pets with fleas that your
   children pick up and distribute.

   Grin and bear it is the obvious solution, at least when it comes the
   adults. Suck your way through cups of ill-brewed tea and leave after a
   quick biscuit or accepting the invitation for a glass of something
   stronger. Pretend you have an eating disorder when invited over for
   dinner. Otherwise, the best solution is just to leave it alone and
   complain behind their backs. Hypocrisy has served the British well for
   centuries and it has a lot to commend it. Any attempt to curtail the
   behaviour of the parents is liable to be seen as snooty and high-minded
   and is bound to fail.

   The children are another matter. You’ll almost certainly get away with
   it. That’s the beauty of the whole thing. Because all parents know
   their children are so lovable no one could ever wish them ill. That’s
   certainly the case with mine, who I know are beyond all possibility of
   being covertly persecuted by my parental peers. Or that’s what I tell
   them, anyway.
