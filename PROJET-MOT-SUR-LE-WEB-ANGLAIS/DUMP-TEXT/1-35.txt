   A dad posted to Twitter a screenshot of what he said was a
   multiple-choice question from his son’s high school health test.

   The question asked for a definition of “family.” His son chose “a
   collection of related-by-blood individuals living together.”

   But that was the wrong answer.

     My son was marked down 5 percent on a high school health test
     because he chose this "incorrect" definition of family.

   The correct choice? “A collection of individuals who care for and about
   each other.”

   Will Saleton said his son was marked down 5 percent “because he chose
   this ‘incorrect’ definition of family.”

   Some responders to Saleton’s post noted that mothers and fathers aren’t
   related by blood and that many parents adopt, which would make his
   son’s choice incorrect anyway. Saleton and others noted that often kids
   are too young to “care for” adults in a household, which makes the
   “correct” answer insufficient.

   One responder noted that the “correct” answer “reduces family to any
   group of strangers.”

   What do you say the definition of “family” is? Let us know in the
   comments!
