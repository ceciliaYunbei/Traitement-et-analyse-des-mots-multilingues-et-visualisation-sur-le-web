Tinkering with the definition of “family” leads to family court disasters

   I’ve been going back to this story a few times this week and it
   continues to disturb me. Yahoo News has a report of two families and
   one innocent child who have been essentially ripped apart through
   experiments in modern reproductive medicine and a court system which
   seems to be intractably stuck in the past and unable to deal with the
   complexities introduced to the definition of the family by modern
   technology. The entire, heartbreaking tale is too long to excerpt
   anything meaningful, so allow me to briefly summarize.

   The pseudonymous couple “Barbara and David” were having trouble
   conceiving and enlisted the assistance of another married woman,
   “Jamie.” After many interviews and negotiations, Jamie signed a
   contract in which she agreed to act as a surrogate mother to a child
   conceived in vitro using her own egg and David’s sperm. In return she
   was paid a significant fee and had all of her ongoing medical costs
   covered. Long story short; most of what Jamie told Barbara and David
   about her life turned out to be fictional and when the child, Kaylee
   Grace, was born, Jamie bailed out on the agreement and kept the child
   for herself.

   This led to a court battle which has run on for seven years and
   produced a not only emotional, but financial disaster for Barbara and
   David.

     The courts originally divided custody between the two parties, but
     in September 2014, despite a court ordered therapist’s
     recommendation for Kaylee Grace to live with Barbara and David, they
     lost shared physical custody when Kaylee started kindergarten in
     Jamie’s school district.

     Barbara and David now have to pay $459 in child support (David
     shares legal custody with Jamie) and are only allowed to spend two
     weekends a month with their daughter. But despite that court ruling,
     they say they haven’t see their daughter since October 2015.

   At this point it sounds as if Barbara and David are simply out of
   options and stuck in an indefensible situation for the next decade or
   more. Family Court in this country is simply not equipped to deal with
   this situation and millions more like it. The couple was told during
   the pursuit of their case that that they “can’t make a contract on a
   human life” and the judge admitted that she didn’t know what to do with
   such a document. In other words, even with a good team of lawyers,
   these agreements all too often are completely unenforceable.

   We’re not just talking about cases of surrogate mothers here either.
   We’ve seen multiple instances of men who agree to be sperm donors,
   either as a favor to another family or completely anonymously through a
   sperm bank, held up at virtual gunpoint to pay decades of child support
   for offspring they never agreed to raise or support. Same sex couples
   who seek such remedies to start a family constantly see one parent left
   with no rights concerning the child after a break-up, while sometimes
   still having to pay support as well.

   What’s the solution to all of this? If the courts can’t adapt to this
   new playing field I certainly understand if men decide to simply never
   get involved in such biological donations to help out infertile
   families. Even on the question of surrogacy, why take the risk of
   getting involved if it may end up in heartbreak and financially
   crippling judgements in court? Perhaps a more old school, conservative
   view would be to say that we’re tinkering with the definition of
   “family” far too much and we’ve opened up Pandora’s Box, bringing all
   this upon ourselves.

   If there’s a government based solution to this quandary I don’t know
   what it is. And given the government’s track record for handling such
   things I wouldn’t put much stock in whatever they come up with anyway.
   But that doesn’t change the fact that a great deal of wrong is being
   done as a consequence of someone trying to do something right. (Or, in
   the case of David, Barbara and Jamie, someone looking to profit off the
   misery of others.) We either need to reform the family court system or
   do a better job of warning people against getting involved in this type
   of family roulette in the first place.
