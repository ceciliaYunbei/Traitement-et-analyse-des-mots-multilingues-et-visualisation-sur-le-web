Pope to release landmark text on the definition of family

   VATICAN CITY (RNS) Pope Francis’ landmark text on the family, scheduled
   for release on Friday, is expected to encourage a more open attitude
   toward the non-nuclear family but contain no change in church doctrine.

   The apostolic exhortation, “Amoris Laetitia” (“The Joy of Love”), will
   be the culmination of two synods in which family matters were hotly
   debated by bishops. Since the second such conference concluded in
   October, Francis has been charged with producing a defining text to
   determine the Catholic Church’s way forward on everything from divorce
   to pornography.

   The world’s 1.2 billion Catholics will likely find a push for pastoral
   care and a less rigid focus on doctrine.

   That is not to say the pontiff is about to sweep aside the rules
   that govern the Catholic Church. Progressives will be disappointed by
   the likely decision not to alter the definition of gay relationships as
   “intrinsically disordered,” nor rule that divorced and remarried
   Catholics can receive Communion.

   John S. Grabowski, an associate professor at Catholic University of
   America who served as an expert to the 2015 synod, said the pope will
   recognize families in different forms without delinking family from
   marriage and parenthood.

   He said Francis will be “talking about the family as multigenerational,
   not just nuclear. He’s casting the net of family more widely and more
   inclusively,” Grabowski told RNS.

   But he added there will be no opening to same-sex couples. “At various
   points, Pope Francis has been insistent that having a mother and a
   father is non-negotiable.”

   Despite this, the pope is expected to call on priests to accompany
   Catholics who fall afoul of church rules, as opposed to criticizing
   them, Grabowski said.

   Gerard Mannion, a professor in Catholic studies at Georgetown
   University, said the apostolic exhortation will overall be a positive
   text that moves away from the “one size fits all” standard.

   “It will be a shift in tone on the church’s intervention of family
   life, human relations and sexuality,” he told RNS.

   “The hint I get is that the emphasis and way forward is the need for
   stressing pastoral realism. That would reflect Francis’ major teaching
   documents to date,” Mannion added. “He’s a very realistic and
   pastoral-oriented pope.”

   This recognition of different realities, including the impacts of
   migration on families and marriages between faiths, will likely result
   in the pope’s push for discernment at the local level.

   Francis is additionally expected to use his text to call for greater
   guidance for young Catholics as they embark on marriage and having a
   family, while also stating that issues such as violence and sexual
   abuse should be addressed.

   But although the word from the pope has been eagerly anticipated,
   Mannion predicted the compassionate and inclusive text will push the
   focus away from the Vatican: “For pastors and lay people (the pope)
   will stress that they have to dialogue and listen to their conscience;
   it’s not going to be Rome dictating what happens.”
