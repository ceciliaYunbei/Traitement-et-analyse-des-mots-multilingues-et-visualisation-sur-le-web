   by Laura Chubb

   Australia’s Opposition leader Bill Shorten has said it is time for the
   country to change its ‘1950s’ definition of family, adding that
   ‘people’s relationships don’t need opinion polls from other people’.

   Shorten strongly opposes the public referendum on marriage equality
   that has been promised by prime minister Malcolm Turnbull if he is
   re-elected. Whether this will go ahead is now in some doubt as the
   results of the election may produce a hung parliament.

   Shorten opened up about his own experiences as a stepfather on ABC show
   Kitchen Cabinet this week, saying: ‘This 1950s definition of what
   constitutes a family, I don’t think that describes not just gay couples
   with kids but I don’t think it describes blended families.’

Gay marriage in Australia: relationships don’t need opinion polls

   Shorten had been criticized for his anti-gay marriage referendum stance
   this week after it emerged he told an Australian Christian Lobby forum
   three years ago he was ‘completely relaxed’ about having such a
   referendum.

   But when quizzed by Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb, he said he’d
   had a change of heart after becoming stepfather to his wife’s two
   children from a previous relationship.

   Shorten is married to Chloe Bryce, with whom he had a child,
   Clementine, in 2009. He is also stepfather to Bryce’s son and daughter,
   Rupert and Georgette.

   ‘The experience of being a father, of being a stepfather, has opened my
   eyes that people’s relationships don’t need opinion polls from other
   people,’ he said.

   ‘One of the reasons why I support marriage equality is that
   same-sex-attracted couples who love each other and have kids, why
   should their kids somehow feel invalidated or that somehow their
   parents, their carers, that their relationships are any less valuable
   or wanted?’

‘Politicians should protect people from prejudice’

   Speaking about the role of politicians in society, Shorten said it was
   their job to ensure people can live their lives without fear of
   prejudice. The inference is that holding a referendum on same-sex
   marriage only opens the door to prejudicial views being aired in public
   and aimed at gay parent families.

   Shorten recently claimed he did not think Turnbull believed there
   should be a referendum either, and had only proposed it to placate
   conservative members of his party and shore up his position as prime
   minister.

   The move has been likened to UK prime minister David Cameron’s European
   Union (EU) ‘Brexit’ referendum, which he used as a bargaining chip to
   remain prime minister during last year’s UK general election.

   Cameron’s gamble backfired spectacularly when the UK voted to leave the
   EU last week, forcing his resignation. Cameron had campaigned to remain
   in the EU.

   The ‘leave’ campaign in the UK has been criticized for legitimizing
   racist attitudes because it had focused on immigration issues. It is
   feared that Australia’s gay marriage referendum could do the same for
   anti-gay views.
