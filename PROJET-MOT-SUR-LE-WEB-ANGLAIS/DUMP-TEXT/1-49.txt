IRS Regulations Clarify Definition of Spouse for Federal Tax Purposes in
Light of Obergefell v. Hodges

   The IRS has issued final regulations clarifying the definitions of
   “spouse,” “husband,” “wife,” and “husband and wife” for federal tax
   purposes. The final regulations now define “spouse,” “husband” and
   “wife” as any individual lawfully married to another individual, and
   “husband and wife” as any two individuals lawfully married to each
   other, regardless of the individuals’ sex.

   The clarification was needed after the Supreme Court ruled in
   Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 that state bans on same-sex marriage
   violated the Equal Protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.
   Obergefell struck down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional in
   four states (Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee), resolving a
   circuit split on the issue. (As previously discussed here, the
   Obergefell decision was anticipated after the Court ruled in U.S. v.
   Windsor that the authority to define marriage lay with the states, but
   declined to rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage. For
   more on the Windsor case, click here.)

   Following Obergefell, the IRS issued proposed regulations redefining
   “spouse” for federal tax purposes. The proposed regulations also
   provided that a recognized marriage for federal tax purposes was a
   marriage recognized by any U.S. state, possession or territory.
   However, commentators pointed out that such a definition was too broad.
   For example, the proposed regulations’ definition of marriage could
   have caused taxpayers living in common-law marriages not recognized by
   their state to nonetheless be treated as married if any other U.S.
   state or territory would recognize their marriage. As a result, the
   final regulations provide that a marriage is recognized for federal tax
   purposes if the marriage is recognized in the U.S. state, possession or
   territory where the marriage is entered into – also known as the “state
   of celebration” rule. The final regulations do not recognize as a
   marriage for federal tax purposes alternative legal relationships such
   as registered domestic partnerships or civil unions. The final
   regulations also contain rules on recognition of foreign marriages. The
   full text of the final regulations can be found here.

   These regulations should offer clarity to same-sex partners for estate
   and tax planning matters. For more information on how these regulations
   affect you or your family, please contact Amanda Tate
   (atate@bakerlaw.com) or Chad Makuch (cmakuch@bakerlaw.com).
