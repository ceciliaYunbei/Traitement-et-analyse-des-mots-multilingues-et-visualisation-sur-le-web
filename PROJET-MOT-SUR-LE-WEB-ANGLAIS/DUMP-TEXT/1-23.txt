The end of the ‘typical’ American family

   The "typical" America family of the 1950s -- a working Dad, a
   homemaking Mom bringing up the kids -- is no more, replaced by a new
   model that has as its central identifier a diversity of roles.

   There is no one kind of typical family anymore, sociologists are
   saying, and the breadwinner-homemaker model, common since the dawn of
   the Industrial Revolution, has been modified into a range of possible
   family forms.

   "There hasn't been the collapse of one dominant family structure and
   the rise of another," says University of Maryland sociologist Philip
   Cohen. "It's really a fanning out into all kinds of family structures."

   "Different is the new normal," he says.

   In a study prepared for the Council on Contemporary Families, Cohen
   highlights what he says are the three most significant changes in
   American family life during the past 50 years.
     * A decline in marriage: household headed by married couples declined
       from 66 percent in 1960 to 45 percent by 2010.

     * The increase in the numbers of women entering the paid workforce.

     * The rising number of blended, remarried and co-habiting families.

   While in the 1950s 65 percent of all children under the age of 15 were
   growing up in traditional breadwinner-homemaker situations, today only
   22 percent of them are, Cohen points out.

   "In 1960 you would have had an 80 percent chance that two children,
   selected at random, would share the same situation. By 2012, that
   chance had fallen to just a little more than 50-50," he says. "It is
   really impossible to point to a 'typical' family."

   Instead, he says, many children are being raised by single mothers, by
   a parent cohabiting with an unmarried partner, by a single father or by
   grandparents.

   Today's children are much more likely to experience a change in their
   family arrangements at some point in their lives, Cohen says.

   Factors driving the changes in the structure of American families today
   include a changing economy, job opportunities, rising education and
   increasing independence of women, Cohen says.

   These changes have not been matched with changes to government laws and
   policies, such as taxes or regulations governing work hours, that
   affect how families work and live, he points out.

   "Different families have different child-rearing challenges and needs,
   which means we are no longer well-served by policies that assume most
   children will be raised by married-couple families, especially ones
   where the mother stays home throughout the children's early years," he
   says.
