The Disappearing Nuclear Family And The Shift To Non-Traditional Households
Has Serious Financial Implications For Growing Numbers Of Americans

   the MetLife Mature Market Institute

   The 2010 Census revealed surprises about family structure and the
   composition of U.S. households. Disappearing at a rapid rate are homes
   with "traditional" nuclear families -- Mom, Dad and two children.

   Today, more and more Americans live alone. There are blended families,
   single parents, domestic partnerships and more.

   If Robert Young of the 50's TV favorite, "Father Knows Best," was to
   return, he might be a little bewildered, to say nothing of June and
   Ward Cleaver.

   Only 48.4 percent of households have a married couple; 20 percent of
   all households contain married couples who have children living with
   them. According to MetLife, almost 20 percent of households have
   children (of any age) from a prior relationship(s).

   Second in number are households with those living alone, a growing
   segment, 31 million compared to seven million in 1960 and 26.7 percent
   of the U.S. total. 9.6 percent are those headed by single parents,
   according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

   Past Images, New Circumstances

   Why is it, then, that the images we see so often in the media,
   particularly from advertisers and marketers selling us everything from
   soap to IPads, focus so much attention on marrieds with children, the
   growing MINority? The same goes for those promoting financial services
   and retirement investment products.

   Is it a lag in perception about American demographics? Or have we been
   slow to recognize that the aging population and longer life are
   factors?
   Or, is it a matter of where the wealth lies?

   Even though the pool is shrinking, couples are better prepared
   financially than others, especially those in first marriages. According
   to the New American Family study by MetLife's Mature Market Institute,
   more couples than non-couples have lowered their debt, met with a
   financial advisor and invested for retirement. Households headed by
   singles are vulnerable because there's only one income. A job loss can
   be devastating.

   Singles, statistically, have less education than the average American.
   They have the fewest assets and the lowest income. Not surprisingly,
   they report the highest concerns about retirement risks of any group in
   the survey.

   A crisis is developing for those in the majority, the non-traditional
   family.

   While many worry about the future of Social Security and Medicare, they
   are largely uninformed about retirement finances. Just about half have
   calculated how much monthly income they will need in retirement. Only
   28 percent believe they are on track to achieve their goals.

   Seventy-two percent of families surveyed by MetLife have children, most
   of whom are adult children, a huge shift from the 1950s and 1960s. With
   the economic downturn, those children, who may have been a safety net
   in retirement, are just the opposite. Many are turning to their parents
   for financial help, putting the older generation in financial jeopardy.
   Moms and Dads all over the U.S. are helping their sons and daughters
   who have lost jobs, income and houses.

   A recent MetLife study of grandparents confirms such generosity. 62
   percent of grandparents have given monetary gifts to their families and
   43 percent report that they have provided more financial support due to
   the economy. Experts caution that many grandparents do this at their
   own peril, since 34 percent say they are giving even though it is
   negatively affecting on their own bottom lines.

   Generosity may be a liability later when parents and grandparents find
   themselves facing financial risk and must look to those same children
   and grandchildren for support. Nearly four in ten respondents in all
   households, according to the New American Family study cited above, say
   they don't know where they'd turn if they were unable to meet financial
   obligations in retirement. While other studies have shown that children
   are generally there for their parents when needed, they might not be
   able to help if they do not begin making their own financial
   preparations.

   Implications and Advice

   Those in all configurations of families have concerns in common and
   others specific to their circumstances.

   A one-size-fits-all model and a singular approach to the planning
   process do not take into account all the variables. Singles without
   children, for example, are likely to be in greater need of a guaranteed
   income and of protecting against the high cost of long-term and medical
   care. Second-marriage couples in blended families with children from
   both marriages are likely to need sophisticated estate planning tools.
   Domestic partners will require legal assistance for health care
   proxies, employee benefits and inheritance. Couples with children may
   need to take into account the unexpected need to support their children
   and grandchildren.

   In summary, everyone in every type of family can and should take action
   sooner rather than later to seek basic guidance on retirement. They
   should heed the warnings of their elders. As old Jim Anderson of Father
   Knows Best may have wisely advised his kids, start saving early, invest
   wisely and seek the advice of trusted professionals. With that,
   children, parents and grandparents should be able to remain afloat
   throughout their lives without having to be a burden on their families.

   Savings Freeze
   While people pay back their loans, they usually stop contributing to
   their retirement plans. They lose the power of compounding over time
   that is key to making savings grow.
