   family (n.) Look up family at Dictionary.com
          early 15c., "servants of a household," from Latin familia
          "family servants, domestics collectively, the servants in a
          household," thus also "members of a household, the estate,
          property; the household, including relatives and servants,"
          abstract noun formed from famulus "servant, slave," which is of
          unknown origin.
          The Latin word rarely appears in the sense "parents with their
          children," for which domus (see domestic (adj.)) was used.
          Derivatives of famulus include famula "serving woman, maid,"
          famulanter "in the manner of a servant," famulitas "servitude,"
          familiaris "of one's household, private," familiaricus "of
          household slaves," familiaritas "close friendship."
          In English, sense of "collective body of persons who form one
          household under one head and one domestic government, including
          parents, children, and servants, and as sometimes used even
          lodgers or boarders" [Century Dictionary] is from 1540s. From
          1660s as "parents with their children, whether they dwell
          together or not," also in a more general sense, "persons closely
          related by blood, including aunts, uncles, cousins;" earlier
          "those who descend from a common progenitor, a house, a lineage"
          (1580s). Hence, "any group of things classed as kindred based on
          common distinguishing characteristics" (1620s); as a scientific
          classification, between genus and order, from 1753.

     I have certainly known more men destroyed by the desire to have wife
     and child and to keep them in comfort than I have seen destroyed by
     drink and harlots. [William Butler Yeats, "Autobiography"]

          Replaced Old English hiwscipe, hiwan "family," cognate with Old
          Norse hjon "one of the household; married couple, man and wife;
          domestic servant," and with Old High German hiwo "husband," hiwa
          "wife," also with Lithuanian šeimyna "family," Gothic haims
          "village," Old English ham "village, home" (see home (n.)).
          As an adjective from c. 1600; with the meaning "suitable for a
          family," by 1807. Family values first recorded 1966. Phrase in a
          family way "pregnant" is from 1796. Family circle is 1809;
          family man "man devoted to wife and children, man inclined to
          lead a domestic life" is 1856 (earlier it meant "thief," 1788,
          from family in a slang sense of "the fraternity of thieves").
          Family-tree "graph of ancestral relations" attested from 1752:

     He was dressed in his best Coat, which had served him in the same
     Capacity before my Birth, and possibly, might be but little short in
     Antiquity, to the Root of his third Family Tree; and indeed, he made
     a venerable Figure in it. ["A Genuine Account of the Life and
     Transactions of Howell ap David Price, Gentleman of Wales," London,
     1752]
