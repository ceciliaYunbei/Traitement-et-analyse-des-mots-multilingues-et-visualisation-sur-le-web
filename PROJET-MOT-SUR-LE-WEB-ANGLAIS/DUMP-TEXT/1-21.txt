How Family Structure has Changed

   Your feedback and suggestions will help us improve this site: Take
   our online user survey

   Data about family structure illustrate how individuals in an area are
   organized into different family arrangements.

What is a Family?

   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family is "a group of two or
   more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage,
   or adoption" (U.S. Census Bureau). Though this definition seems
   straightforward, where do married couples or parents and children who
   live in different places fit in this definition of family? What about
   aunts and uncles who regularly care for their nieces or nephews while
   the parents work? According to the Census Bureau's definition, these
   relatively common family arrangements are not officially recognized as
   families. While the Bureau's definition of families is clear and is
   easily tracked over time, it is important to recognize that not all of
   our families fit this definition.

   In fact, across time and cultures, using the Census Bureau definition
   of family is an inappropriate way to measure and examine families. In
   ancient Greece and in feudal Europe, a family was all of the people who
   contributed to the household financial system, including servants
   (Coltrane and Collins, 2001). In many cultures today, non-parental
   adults are also considered part of the family if they play a large role
   in raising or looking after the children of others. These examples
   highlight the fact that, though the Census definition is clear and
   helpful, there is no single understanding of what a family is; its
   definition varies across many groups of people.

How Have Families Changed over Time, and Why?

   The structures, or forms, of the family vary as much as the definition
   itself. There is no single "true" family form. In Western Europe the
   nuclear family (a single set of biological parents residing together
   with their children) was prevalent in the Middle Ages, but at that same
   time in Eastern Europe multiple generations of the same family lived
   together in the same household (Coltrane and Collins, 2001). Indeed,
   the United States has also seen many types of family forms throughout
   its short history. Stephanie Coontz's (2005) research on the history of
   marriage reveals that the family forms we see today in the U.S. are
   actually the result of an evolution of the family that began with an
   important shift in the culture of marriage in the mid-18^th Century.

   Coontz (2005) found that only in the mid- to late-18^th Century in
   Western Europe and North America "did the notion of free choice and
   marriage for love triumph as a cultural ideal...[opening] the way for
   it to become an optional and fragile [institution]" thus influencing
   the structure of the family at that time and into the future (p. 7).
   Earlier in history, during the Stone and Middle Ages, marriage was not
   based on love and men and women had very little choice about whom they
   married. In the Stone Age men and women married in order to improve the
   economic situation of their respective clans, then in the Middle Ages
   and into the 18^th Century marriage served the economic and political
   needs of a particular extended family group (Coontz, 2005).

   As marriage evolved in the mid- to late-18^th Century into a union
   based on love, other economic, cultural, and political shifts in the
   U.S. and in other nations were happening that would further influence
   the structure of the family. In the 19^th Century an ideal of the
   husband as breadwinner and the wife as homemaker became popular, but
   the majority of families could not achieve this ideal, as few jobs paid
   wages high enough to support a single-earner family. This changed as
   World War II ended and the U.S. experienced a time of dramatic economic
   growth. The economic prosperity of the time combined with the popular
   cultural ideal gave rise to family trends in the 1950s and early 1960s
   that had never been seen before. "Ozzie and Harriet" families that
   married young, remained married, and had many children were the major
   family form at this time (McLanahan and Casper, 2001). The realization
   of the Ozzie and Harriet ideal did not last long, however. In the late
   1960s and 1970s divorce rates rose, births to unmarried women
   increased, and the average age of first marriage also rose. The reasons
   for these changes in the '60s and '70s were many: real wages for women
   rose while those for men fell, the economy weakened, wives joined the
   workforce due to the downturn in the economy, and women gained access
   to legal rights, education, birth control, and paid work (McLanahan and
   Casper, 2001; Coltrane and Collins, 2001). This historical examination
   of the evolution of the family and marriage shows that the family has
   constantly been under pressure to evolve and shift with changes in the
   economy, our values, and even politics. The evolution of marriage into
   an institution of love along with changes in the economy, our culture,
   and the political scene since the 1950s has meant that American men and
   women have been able to realize their ideals of the male breadwinner
   and marriage for the sake of love and personal freedom as time changes.

   These influences and trends in marriage, divorce, and non-marital
   fertility did not escape rural America. Comparing urban and rural parts
   of the country between 1950 and 1970 reveals, however, that rural
   divorce rates were lower, fewer women age 20-24 were unmarried, and the
   number of children per 1,000 ever married women age 35-44 was slightly
   higher in rural America (Brown, 1981). The changes in marriage,
   divorce, and fertility we observe during the 20^th Century in all parts
   of the U.S. demonstrate that the structure of families are changing and
   becoming more diverse. While there are now many forms available to
   people, the family itself is not disappearing.

Why Do Families Matter?

   The increasing diversity of the family in the U.S. has led scholars to
   examine if and how different family forms are associated with different
   groups of people who then may experience different outcomes. Research
   has found that not all racial groups participate in each family type
   equally, thus not all family forms are equally available to all people
   (McLanahan and Casper, 2001). Scholars have also found that each type
   of family (e.g., married with kids, married with no kids, single-parent
   with young children, etc.) is associated with different economic,
   child, and health outcomes. Demographers Sara McLanahan and Lynne
   Casper (2001) explain that past research has found that:

   Children who grow up with only one of their parents"¦are more likely to
   drop out of high school, to become teenage and single mothers, and to
   have trouble finding and keeping a steady job in young adulthood, even
   after adjusting for differences in parents' socioeconomic background
   (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). (p. 6)

   They clarify, however, that "about half of the disadvantages associated
   with single parenthood are due to lower incomes [of single parents].
   Most of the rest are due to too little parental involvement and
   supervision and too much residential mobility" (p. 6). Stephanie Coontz
   (2005) also clarifies that the psychological, health, and economic
   benefits of marriage for families are due to a number of factors like:
   the effect of selection (people who are already healthier, more
   psychologically stable, and better able to manage finances tend to
   marry more than those who are not), the "expectations about
   responsibility, fidelity, and intimacy" in marriage, and the freedom to
   exit psychologically, physically, and economically stressful unhappy
   marriages (p. 309-310). While we see increasing diversity in family
   types in the U.S. across time it is clear that not all types lead to
   equal outcomes or are equally available to all.

   Are there differences in family structures between urban and rural
   Oregon communities in 1990 and 2000? Did the prevalence of some family
   forms change in some places between 1990 and 2000? Are there
   communities with high rates of single parenthood? Why do you think they
   are high?

Family Structure-Related Terms

   Using the tools of the Oregon Communities Explorer you can examine
   family trends across the state among the following variables:
