Family Leave Needs To Be Bigger, Broader, And Gayer

   I remember my mornings before kindergarten class and how much I enjoyed
   the time being at home and relaxing. My mother would make me a quick
   lunch, which I ate while watching The Puzzle Place on PBS, before she
   would drive me to school.

   My mother chose to stay home with me and my older sister to raise us
   while my dad worked full-time until we were both in elementary school.
   She then returned to work part-time at a senior citizens’ home and then
   eventually got a job working in our school’s cafeteria.

   But that was a long time ago when a family could live off of one
   salary, when childcare wouldn’t cost you your first born, when POGS and
   crimped hair were cool.

   It was also when gay families and the LGBT community in general were
   beginning to fight their way out of the margins of society into which
   they were shoved.

   But the times are changing. And family leave needs to catch up.

   -          -          -           -          -          -         -
       -         -         -        -         -

   I took for granted the experience I had with my mother staying home and
   waiting a few years to return to work. I never really had to think
   twice about it, and I never even thanked her for it. (I am thanking you
   now, Mom!)

   But as I get older, I see my friends and family members having children
   and being forced to drain their resources to afford childcare. It’s
   forcing me to wake up to the hardships that so many people face and the
   sacrifices so many must make as a result of an inadequate system.

   And as a gay person, I can’t help but think about the possibility of
   one day needing or wanting to provide care for one of my precious
   chosen family members.

   The Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) was signed to “help working
   parents and other caregivers balance work and family.” Of course, its
   definition of “family” is very narrow, and although last summer’s
   Supreme Court decision ruling in favor of marriage equality solidified
   the right of workers to take leave (unpaid, of course) in order to care
   for a same-sex spouse, there are still many folks left out of the FMLA.

   What’s great about generations like mine is that we are helping lead
   the way towards the acceptance of broader definitions of identity
   across the board. Young LGBT people like me are also redefining what it
   means to be “family.” Many of us have been rejected by our biological
   parents and have had to seek comfort and care elsewhere. And in many
   cases, these chosen family members love us more than our blood
   relatives ever could.

   We find mothers in older lesbians in the community, we find brothers in
   fellow gay men in the community, we find sisters and fathers and so
   much more.

   Yet if my friend, who I define as family, falls ill and has no one else
   in their life to help them, I am vulnerable at work if I choose to
   leave for a while in order to provide care. If someone I know is
   transgender and needs help recuperating after gender reassignment
   surgery, my job is legally not protected if I choose to take care of my
   beloved friend who has no blood relatives to step up.

   And the issue of expanding the definition of “family” isn’t just a gay
   issue.

   If my niece is in an accident, God forbid, and my sister and
   brother-in-law are desperate for an extra hand to help with her
   recovery, I am not permitted to do so without my job being at risk or
   my finances being in jeopardy.

   Domestic partners, yes even straight ones, are also not covered
   federally under the FMLA. To couples who choose not to pursue what
   society views as traditional “marriage,” this deals a major blow. I
   cannot imagine the helplessness I would feel if my ill partner or
   friend or aunt was forced to go without care, or was subjected to
   sub-par care, because the law doesn’t value our relationship as much as
   the conventional “spouse-spouse” or “parent-child.”

   The FMLA was a start. But it sure as hell isn’t a cure-all. It’s barely
   a band-aid.

   So what do we need to do?

   We need to recognize that marriage equality was only the beginning.
   Those of us who are fighting to change perceptions of the LGBT
   community need to use that passion to take up this fight for improved
   family and medical leave. It affects us, it affects our loved ones, and
   it affects the advancement of our society as a whole.

   We must continue challenging our policy makers to step up and catch up
   to the 21st century. This country is made up of so many diverse,
   beautiful, hard-working people, and every single one of them deserves
   to be treated with dignity.

   We need to force legislators and employers to look at things
   differently and with a wider lens. We need to consider allowing
   employees to work remotely from home, allowing them to make schedules
   that work for them, and allowing people to take leave to care for the
   person they love, regardless of the type of tie that bonds them.

   We need to collectively organize and vote for progressive candidates
   who will work to expand the legal definitions of family within the FMLA
   for everyone and advocate for paid, not unpaid, leave.

   We need to push the government and businesses to value the time and the
   lives and the families of every worker, whether they are the CEO of a
   Fortune 500 company or a fast-food worker who sweats bullets in a hot
   kitchen all day. Family leave shouldn’t just be for white-collar
   workers. Every single worker who grinds day in and day out to put food
   on their table deserves paid family and medical leave.

   These are vows we must make to each other ― for richer or for poorer,
   in sickness and in health.

   And, most importantly, in love.
