   In the context of human society, a family (from Latin: familia) is a
   group of people affiliated either by consanguinity (by recognized
   birth), affinity (by marriage or any other relation ship like siblings
   families etc..), or co-residence (as implied by the etymology of the
   English word "family"^[1]) or some combination of these. Members of the
   immediate family include spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons,
   and/or daughters. Members of the extended family may include
   grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and/or
   siblings-in-law. Sometimes these are also considered members of the
   immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship
   with them.

   In most societies, the family is the principal institution for the
   socialization of children. As the basic unit for raising children,
   anthropologists generally classify most family organizations as
   matrifocal (a mother and her children); conjugal (a husband, his wife,
   and children, also called the nuclear family); avuncular (for example,
   a grandparent, a brother, his sister, and her children); or extended
   (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's
   family). Sexual relations among the members are regulated by rules
   concerning incest such as the incest taboo.

   The word "family" can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive
   categories such as community, nationhood, global village and humanism.

   The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history.

   Family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics.

Social[edit]

   One of the primary functions of the family involves providing a
   framework for the production and reproduction of persons, biologically
   and/or socially. This can occur through the sharing of material
   substances (such as food); the giving and receiving of care and nurture
   (nurture kinship); jural rights and obligations; and moral and
   sentimental ties.^[2]^[3] Thus, one's experience of one's family shifts
   over time. From the perspective of children, the family is a "family of
   orientation": the family serves to locate children socially and plays a
   major role in their enculturation and socialization.^[4] From the point
   of view of the parent(s), the family is a "family of procreation," the
   goal of which is to produce and enculturate and socialize children.^[5]
   However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in
   societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting
   relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of
   an economically productive household.^[6]^[7]^[8]

   Christopher Harris notes that the western conception of family is
   ambiguous, and confused with the household, as revealed in the
   different contexts in which the word is used.^[9] Olivia Harris states
   this confusion is not accidental, but indicative of the familial
   ideology of capitalist, western countries that pass social legislation
   that insists members of a nuclear family should live together, and that
   those not so related should not live together; despite the ideological
   and legal pressures, a large percentage of families do not conform to
   the ideal nuclear family type.^[10]

Types of family[edit]

   Diverse data from ethnography, history, law and social statistics,
   reveal the human family as a social institution and not as a biological
   fact founded on the relationship of consanguinity.^[11]^[12] The
   different types of families occur in a wide variety of settings, and
   their specific functions and meanings depend largely on their
   relationship to other social institutions. Although early western
   cultural anthropologists and sociologists considered family and kinship
   to be universally associated with relations by "blood" (based on ideas
   common in their own cultures) later research^[2] has shown that many
   societies instead understand family through ideas of living together,
   the sharing of food (e.g. milk kinship) and sharing care and nurture.
   Sociologists have a special interest in the function and status of
   family forms in stratified (especially capitalist) societies.^[citation
   needed]

   According to the work of scholars Max Weber, Alan Macfarlane, Steven
   Ozment, Jack Goody and Peter Laslett, the huge transformation that led
   to modern marriage in Western democracies was "fueled by the
   religio-cultural value system provided by elements of Judaism, early
   Christianity, Roman Catholic canon law and the Protestant
   Reformation".^[13]

   Much sociological, historical and anthropological research dedicates
   itself to the understanding of this variation, and of changes in the
   family that form over time. Levitan claims:

     "Times have changed; it is more acceptable and encouraged for
     mothers to work and fathers to spend more time at home with the
     children. The way roles are balanced between the parents will help
     children grow and learn valuable life lessons. There is great
     importance of communication and equality in families, in order to
     avoid role strain."^[14]

Conjugal (nuclear or single) family[edit]

   The term "nuclear family" is commonly used, especially in the United
   States of America, to refer to conjugal families. A "conjugal" family
   includes only the husband, the wife, and unmarried children who are not
   of age.^[15] Sociologists distinguish between conjugal families
   (relatively independent of the kindred of the parents and of other
   families in general) and nuclear families (which maintain relatively
   close ties with their kindred).^[citation needed] Other family
   structures, such as blended parents, single parents, and domestic
   partnerships have begun to challenge the normality of the nuclear
   family.^[16]

Matrifocal family[edit]

   Main article: Matrifocal family

   A "matrifocal" family consists of a mother and her children. Generally,
   these children are her biological offspring, although adoption of
   children is a practice in nearly every society. This kind of family
   occurs commonly where women have the resources to rear their children
   by themselves, or where men are more mobile than women. As a
   definition, "a family or domestic group is matrifocal when it is
   centred on a woman and her children. In this case the father(s) of
   these children are intermittently present in the life of the group and
   occupy a secondary place. The children's mother is not necessarily the
   wife of one of the children's fathers."^[17]

Extended family[edit]

   Sweden, early 20th century
   A family from Basankusu, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

   The term "extended family" is also common, especially in the United
   States. This term has two distinct meanings:
    1. First, it serves as a synonym of "consanguinal family" (consanguine
       means "of the same blood").
    2. Second, in societies dominated by the conjugal family, it refers to
       "kindred" (an egocentric network of relatives that extends beyond
       the domestic group) who do not belong to the conjugal family.

   These types refer to ideal or normative structures found in particular
   societies. Any society will exhibit some variation in the actual
   composition and conception of families.

Family of choice[edit]

   The term "family of choice," also sometimes referred to as "chosen
   family," is common within the queer community, both in academic
   literature and in colloquial vocabulary. It refers to the group of
   people in an individual's life that satisfies the typical role of
   family as a support system. The term differentiates between the "family
   of origin" (the biological family or that in which people are raised)
   and those that actively assume that ideal role.^[18] The family of
   choice may or may not include some or all of the members of the family
   of origin. This terminology stems from the fact that many LGBT
   individuals, upon coming out, face rejection or shame from the families
   they were raised in. The term family of choice is also used by
   individuals in the 12 step communities, who create close knit "family"
   ties through the recovery process.

Blended family[edit]

   The term blended family or stepfamily describes families with mixed
   parents: one or both parents remarried, bringing children of the former
   family into the new family.^[19] Also in sociology, particularly in the
   works of social psychologist Michael Lamb,^[20] traditional family
   refers to "a middleclass family with a bread-winning father and a
   stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological
   children," and nontraditional to exceptions from this rule. Most of the
   US households are now non-traditional under this definition.^[21]

   In terms of communication patterns in families, there are a certain set
   of beliefs within the family that reflect how its members should
   communicate and interact. These family communication patterns arise
   from two underlying sets of beliefs. One being conversation orientation
   (the degree to which the importance of communication is valued) and
   two, conformity orientation (the degree to which families should
   emphasize similarities or differences regarding attitudes, beliefs, and
   values).^[22]

Monogamous family[edit]

   A monogamous family is based on legal or social monogamy. In this case,
   an individual has only one (official) partner during their lifetime or
   at any one time (i.e. serial monogamy).^[23] This means that a person
   may not have several different legal spouses at the same time, as this
   is usually prohibited by bigamy laws, in jurisdictions that require
   monogamous marriages.

Polygamous family[edit]

   Polygamy is a marriage that includes more than two partners.^[24]^[25]
   When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, the relationship
   is called polygyny; and when a woman is married to more than one
   husband at a time, it is called polyandry. If a marriage includes
   multiple husbands and wives, it can be called polyamory,^[26] group or
   conjoint marriage.^[25]

Polygyny[edit]

   Polygyny is a form of plural marriage, in which a man is allowed more
   than one wife .^[27] In modern countries that permit polygamy, polygyny
   is typically the only form permitted. Polygyny is practiced primarily
   (but not only) in parts of the Middle East and Africa; and is often
   associated with Islam, however there are certain conditions in Islam
   that must be met to perform polygyny.

Polyandry[edit]

   Polyandry is a form of marriage whereby a woman takes two or more
   husbands at the same time.^[28] Fraternal polyandry, where two or more
   brothers are married to the same wife, is a common form of polyandry.
   Polyandry was traditionally practiced in areas of the Himalayan
   mountains, among Tibetans in Nepal, in parts of China and in parts of
   northern India. Polyandry is most common in societies marked by high
   male mortality or where males will often be apart from the rest of the
   family for a considerable period of time.^[28]

Terminologies[edit]

   Main article: Kinship terminology

   In his book Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family,
   anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881) performed the first
   survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Although much
   of his work is now considered dated, he argued that kinship
   terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most
   kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between
   a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between
   a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies
   distinguish between relatives by blood and marriage (although recently
   some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in
   terms other than "blood").

   Morgan made a distinction between kinship systems that use
   classificatory terminology and those that use descriptive terminology.
   Classificatory systems are generally and erroneously understood to be
   those that "class together" with a single term relatives who actually
   do not have the same type of relationship to ego. (What defines "same
   type of relationship" under such definitions seems to be genealogical
   relationship. This is problematic given that any genealogical
   description, no matter how standardized, employs words originating in a
   folk understanding of kinship.) What Morgan's terminology actually
   differentiates are those (classificatory) kinship systems that do not
   distinguish lineal and collateral relationships and those (descriptive)
   kinship systems that do. Morgan, a lawyer, came to make this
   distinction in an effort to understand Seneca inheritance practices. A
   Seneca man's effects were inherited by his sisters' children rather
   than by his own children.^[31] Morgan identified six basic patterns of
   kinship terminologies:
     * Hawaiian: only distinguishes relatives based upon sex and
       generation.
     * Sudanese: no two relatives share the same term.
     * Eskimo: in addition to distinguishing relatives based upon sex and
       generation, also distinguishes between lineal relatives and
       collateral relatives.
     * Iroquois: in addition to sex and generation, also distinguishes
       between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation.
     * Crow: a matrilineal system with some features of an Iroquois
       system, but with a "skewing" feature in which generation is
       "frozen" for some relatives.
     * Omaha: like a Crow system but patrilineal.

Roles[edit]

   Most Western societies employ Eskimo kinship terminology.^[citation
   needed] This kinship terminology commonly occurs in societies based on
   conjugal (or nuclear) families, where nuclear families have a degree of
   relative mobility. Members of the nuclear use descriptive kinship
   terms:
     * Father: a male parent
     * Mother: a female parent
     * Son: a male child of the parent(s)
     * Daughter: a female child of the parent(s)
     * Brother: a male sibling
     * Sister: a female sibling
     * Husband: a male spouse
     * Wife: a female spouse
     * Grandfather: the father of a parent
     * Grandmother: the mother of a parent
     * Cousins: two people who share at least one grandparent in common,
       but none of the same parents.

   Such systems generally assume that the mother's husband is also the
   biological father. In some families, a woman may have children with
   more than one man or a man may have children with more than one woman.
   The system refers to a child who shares only one parent with another
   child as a "half-brother" or "half-sister". For children who do not
   share biological or adoptive parents in common, English-speakers use
   the term "stepbrother" or "stepsister" to refer to their new
   relationship with each other when one of their biological parents
   marries one of the other child's biological parents. Any person (other
   than the biological parent of a child) who marries the parent of that
   child becomes the "stepparent" of the child, either the "stepmother" or
   "stepfather". The same terms generally apply to children adopted into a
   family as to children born into the family. In the United States, one
   in five mothers have children by different fathers; among mothers with
   two or more children the figure is higher, with 28% having children
   with at least two different men. Such families are more common among
   Blacks and Hispanics, and among the lower socioeconomic class.^[32]

   Typically, societies with conjugal families also favor neolocal
   residence; thus upon marriage a person separates from the nuclear
   family of their childhood (family of orientation) and forms a new
   nuclear family (family of procreation). However, in western society the
   single parent family has been growing more accepted and has begun to
   make an impact on culture. Single parent families are more commonly
   single mother families than single father. These families sometimes
   face difficult issues besides the fact that they have to rear their
   children on their own, for example low income making it difficult to
   pay for rent, child care, and other necessities for a healthy and safe
   home. Members of the nuclear families of members of one's own (former)
   nuclear family may class as lineal or as collateral. Kin who regard
   them as lineal refer to them in terms that build on the terms used
   within the nuclear family:
     * Grandparent
          + Grandfather: a parent's father
          + Grandmother: a parent's mother
     * Grandchild
          + Grandson: a child's son
          + Granddaughter: a child's daughter

   For collateral relatives, more classificatory terms come into play,
   terms that do not build on the terms used within the nuclear family:
     * Uncle: parent's brother, or male spouse of parent's sibling
     * Aunt: parent's sister, or female spouse of parent's sibling
     * Nephew: sibling's son, or spouse's sibling's son
     * Niece: sibling's daughter, or spouse's sibling's daughter

   When additional generations intervene (in other words, when one's
   collateral relatives belong to the same generation as one's
   grandparents or grandchildren), the prefixes "great-" or "grand-"
   modifies these terms. Also, as with grandparents and grandchildren, as
   more generations intervene the prefix becomes "great-grand-," adding
   another "great-" for each additional generation. Most collateral
   relatives have never had membership of the nuclear family of the
   members of one's own nuclear family.
     * Cousin: the most classificatory term; the children of uncles or
       aunts. One can further distinguish cousins by degrees of
       collaterality and by generation. Two persons of the same generation
       who share a grandparent count as "first cousins" (one degree of
       collaterality); if they share a great-grandparent they count as
       "second cousins" (two degrees of collaterality) and so on. If two
       persons share an ancestor, one as a grandchild and the other as a
       great-grandchild of that individual, then the two descendants class
       as "first cousins once removed" (removed by one generation); if
       they shared ancestor figures as the grandparent of one individual
       and the great-great-grandparent of the other, the individuals class
       as "first cousins twice removed" (removed by two generations), and
       so on. Similarly, if they shared ancestor figures as the
       great-grandparent of one person and the great-great-grandparent of
       the other, the individuals class as "second cousins once removed".
       Hence one can refer to a "third cousin once removed upwards."

   Cousins of an older generation (in other words, one's parents' first
   cousins), although technically first cousins once removed, are often
   classified with "aunts" and "uncles." Similarly, a person may refer to
   close friends of one's parents as "aunt" or "uncle," or may refer to
   close friends as "brother" or "sister," using the practice of fictive
   kinship. English-speakers mark relationships by marriage (except for
   wife/husband) with the tag "-in-law." The mother and father of one's
   spouse become one's mother-in-law and father-in-law; the female spouse
   of one's child becomes one's daughter-in-law and the male spouse of
   one's child becomes one's son-in-law. The term "sister-in-law" refers
   to three essentially different relationships, either the wife of one's
   sibling, or the sister of one's spouse, or, in some uses, the wife of
   one's spouse's sibling. "Brother-in-law" expresses a similar ambiguity.
   The terms "half-brother" and "half-sister" indicate siblings who share
   only one biological or adoptive parent.

Types of kinship[edit]

Patrilineal[edit]

   Patrilineality, also known as the male line or agnatic kinship, is a
   form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership
   derives from and is traced through his or her father's lineage.^[33] It
   generally involves the inheritance of property, rights, names, or
   titles by persons related through male kin.

   A patriline ("father line") is a person's father, and additional
   ancestors that are traced only through males. One's patriline is thus a
   record of descent from a man in which the individuals in all
   intervening generations are male. In cultural anthropology, a
   patrilineage is a consanguineal male and female kinship group, each of
   whose members is descended from the common ancestor through male
   forebears.

Matrilineal[edit]

   Matrilineality is a form of kinship system in which an individual's
   family membership derives from and is traced through his or her
   mother's lineage.

   It may also correlate with a societal system in which each person is
   identified with their matriline – their mother's lineage – and which
   can involve the inheritance of property and/or titles. A matriline is a
   line of descent from a female ancestor to a descendant in which the
   individuals in all intervening generations are mothers – in other
   words, a "mother line".

   In a matrilineal descent system, an individual is considered to belong
   to the same descent group as her or his mother. This matrilineal
   descent pattern is in contrasts to the more common pattern of
   patrilineal descent pattern.

Bilateral descent[edit]

   Bilateral descent is a form of kinship system in which an individual's
   family membership derives from and is traced through both the paternal
   and maternal sides. The relatives on the mother's side and father's
   side are equally important for emotional ties or for transfer of
   property or wealth. It is a family arrangement where descent and
   inheritance are passed equally through both parents.^[34] Families who
   use this system trace descent through both parents simultaneously and
   recognize multiple ancestors, but unlike with cognatic descent it is
   not used to form descent groups.^[35]

   Traditionally, this is found among some groups in West Africa, India,
   Australia, Indonesia, Melanesia, Malaysia and Polynesia.
   Anthropologists believe that a tribal structure based on bilateral
   descent helps members live in extreme environments because it allows
   individuals to rely on two sets of families dispersed over a wide
   area.^[36]

History of theories[edit]

   Main article: History of the family

Social Darwinists[edit]

   Early scholars of family history applied Darwin's biological theory of
   evolution in their theory of evolution of family systems.^[37] American
   anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan published Ancient Society in 1877 based
   on his theory of the three stages of human progress from Savagery
   through Barbarism to Civilization.^[38] Morgan's book was the
   "inspiration for Friedrich Engels' book" The Origin of the Family,
   Private Property and the State published in 1884.^[39]

   Engels expanded Morgan's hypothesis that economical factors caused the
   transformation of primitive community into a class-divided
   society.^[40] Engels' theory of resource control, and later that of
   Karl Marx, was used to explain the cause and effect of change in family
   structure and function. The popularity of this theory was largely
   unmatched until the 1980s, when other sociological theories, most
   notably structural functionalism, gained acceptance.

The nuclear family in industrial society[edit]

   Family arrangements in the United States have become more diverse with
   no particular household arrangement representing half of the United
   States population.^[41]

   Contemporary society generally views the family as a haven from the
   world, supplying absolute fulfillment. Zinn and Eitzen discuss the
   image of the "family as haven [...] a place of intimacy, love and trust
   where individuals may escape the competition of dehumanizing forces in
   modern society".^[42] During industrialization, "[t]he family as a
   repository of warmth and tenderness (embodied by the mother) stands in
   opposition to the competitive and aggressive world of commerce
   (embodied by the father). The family's task was to protect against the
   outside world."^[43] However, Zinn and Eitzen note, "The protective
   image of the family has waned in recent years as the ideals of family
   fulfillment have taken shape. Today, the family is more compensatory
   than protective. It supplies what is vitally needed but missing in
   other social arrangements."^[44]

   "The popular wisdom", according to Zinn and Eitzen, sees the family
   structures of the past as superior to those today, and families as more
   stable and happier at a time when they did not have to contend with
   problems such as illegitimate children and divorce. They respond to
   this, saying, "there is no golden age of the family gleaming at us in
   the far back historical past."^[45] "Desertion by spouses, illegitimate
   children, and other conditions that are considered characteristics of
   modern times existed in the past as well."^[46]

The postmodern family[edit]

   Percentage of births to unmarried women, selected countries, 1980 and
   2007^[47]

   Others argue that whether or not one views the family as "declining"
   depends on one's definition of "family". "Married couples have dropped
   below half of all American households. This drop is shocking from
   traditional forms of the family system. Only a fifth of households were
   following traditional ways of having married couples raising a family
   together."^[48] In the Western World, marriages are no longer arranged
   for economic, social or political gain, and children are no longer
   expected to contribute to family income. Instead, people choose mates
   based on love. This increased role of love indicates a societal shift
   toward favoring emotional fulfilment and relationships within a family,
   and this shift necessarily weakens the institution of the family.^[49]

   Margaret Mead considers the family as a main safeguard to continuing
   human progress. Observing, "Human beings have learned, laboriously, to
   be human", she adds: "we hold our present form of humanity on trust,
   [and] it is possible to lose it" ... "It is not without significance
   that the most successful large-scale abrogations of the family have
   occurred not among simple savages, living close to the subsistence
   edge, but among great nations and strong empires, the resources of
   which were ample, the populations huge, and the power almost
   unlimited"^[50]

   Many countries (particularly Western) have, in recent years, changed
   their family laws in order to accommodate diverse family models. For
   instance, in the United Kingdom, in Scotland, the Family Law (Scotland)
   Act 2006 provides cohabitants with some limited rights.^[51] In 2010,
   Ireland enacted the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and
   Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. There have also been moves at an
   international level, most notably, the Council of Europe European
   Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock^[52]
   which came into force in 1978. Countries which ratify it must ensure
   that children born outside marriage are provided with legal rights as
   stipulated in the text of this Convention. The Convention was ratified
   by the UK in 1981 and by Ireland in 1988.^[53]

Oedipal family model and fascism[edit]

   The model, common in the western societies, of the family triangle,
   husband-wife-children isolated from the outside, is also called the
   oedipal model of the family, and it is a form of patriarchal family.
   Many philosophers and psychiatrists have analyzed such a model. In such
   a family, they argue, the young develop in a perverse relationship,
   wherein they learn to love the same person who beats and oppresses
   them. They believe that young children grow up and develop loving a
   person who is oppressing them physically or mentally, and that these
   children are not taught in a way that will raise affectionate
   children.^[54] Such philosophers claim that the family therefore
   constitutes the first cell of the fascist society, as the children will
   carry this attitude of love for oppressive figures in their adult
   life.^[55]^[56] They claim that fathers torment their sons.^[57]^[58]
   Deleuze and Guattari, in their analysis of the dynamics at work within
   a family, "track down all varieties of fascism, from the enormous ones
   that surround and crush us to the petty ones that constitute the
   tyrannical bitterness of our everyday lives".^[55]

   As it has been explained by Deleuze, Guattari and Foucault, as well as
   other philosophers and psychiatrists such as Laing and Reich, the
   patriarchal-family conceived in the West tradition serves the purpose
   of perpetuating a propertarian and authoritarian society.^[59] The
   child grows according to the oedipal model, which is typical of the
   structure of capitalist societies,^[11]^[12] and he becomes in turn
   owner of submissive children and protector of the
   woman.^[58]^[60]^[61]^[62]^[63]

   As the young undergoes physical and psychological repression from
   someone for whom they develop love, they develop a loving attitude
   towards authority figures. They will bring such attitude in their adult
   life, when they will desire social repression and will form docile
   subjects for society.^[59] Michel Foucault, in his systematic study of
   sexuality, argued that rather than being merely repressed, the desires
   of the individual are efficiently mobilized and used,^[55] to control
   the individual, alter interpersonal relationships and control the
   masses. Foucault believed organized religion, through moral
   prohibitions, and economic powers, through advertising, make use of
   unconscious sex drives. Dominating desire, they dominate
   individuals.^[64] According to the analysis of Michel Foucault, in the
   west:

     the [conjugal] family organization, precisely to the extent that it
     was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the other power
     mechanisms, was used to support the great "maneuvers" employed for
     the Malthusian control of the birthrate, for the populationist
     incitements, for the medicalization of sex and the psychiatrization
     of its nongenital forms.

Domestic violence[edit]

   Main article: Domestic violence

   Domestic violence (DV) is violence that happens within the family. The
   legal and social understanding of the concept of DV differs by culture.
   The definition of the term "domestic violence" varies, depending on the
   context in which it is used.^[65] It may be defined differently in
   medical, legal, political or social contexts. The definitions have
   varied over time, and vary in different parts of the world.

   The Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and
   domestic violence states that:^[66]

          " “domestic violence” shall mean all acts of physical, sexual,
          psychological or economic violence that occur within the family
          or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or
          partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared
          the same residence with the victim".

   In 1993, the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence
   against Women identified domestic violence as one of three contexts in
   which violence against women occurs, describing it as:^[67]

          "Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the
          family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in
          the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female
          genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to
          women, non-spousal violence and violence related to
          exploitation".

Family violence[edit]

   Family violence is a broader definition, often used to include child
   abuse, elder abuse, and other violent acts between family members.^[68]

   Child abuse is defined by the WHO as:^[69]

          "Child maltreatment, sometimes referred to as child abuse and
          neglect, includes all forms of physical and emotional
          ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that
          results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health,
          development or dignity. Within this broad definition, five
          subtypes can be distinguished – physical abuse; sexual abuse;
          neglect and negligent treatment; emotional abuse; and
          exploitation."

   Elder abuse is, according to the WHO: "a single, or repeated act, or
   lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where
   there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an
   older person".^[70]

Parental abuse of children (child abuse)[edit]

   Main article: Parental abuse of children

   Child abuse is the physical, sexual or emotional maltreatment or
   neglect of a child or children.^[71] In the United States, the Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department for
   Children and Families (DCF) define child maltreatment as any act or
   series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver
   that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a
   child.^[72] Child abuse can occur in a child's home, or in the
   organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There
   are four major categories of child abuse: neglect, physical abuse,
   psychological or emotional abuse, and sexual abuse.

Parental abuse by children[edit]

   Main article: Parental abuse by children

   Abuse of parents by their children is a common but under reported and
   under researched subject. Parents are quite often subject to levels of
   childhood aggression in excess of normal childhood aggressive
   outbursts, typically in the form of verbal or physical abuse. Parents
   feel a sense of shame and humiliation to have that problem, so they
   rarely seek help and there is usually little or no help available
   anyway.^[73]^[74]

Elder abuse[edit]

   Main article: Elder abuse

   Elder abuse is "a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate
   action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation
   of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person."^[75] This
   definition has been adopted by the World Health Organization from a
   definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. Laws
   protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to, and related to, laws
   protecting dependent adults from abuse.

   The core element to the harm of elder abuse is the "expectation of
   trust" of the older person toward their abuser. Thus, it includes harms
   by people the older person knows or with whom they have a relationship,
   such as a spouse, partner or family member, a friend or neighbor, or
   people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of
   elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family
   violence.

Forced and child marriage[edit]

   Main articles: Forced marriage and Child marriage

   Forced and child marriages are practiced in certain regions of the
   world, particularly in Asia and Africa, and these types of marriages
   are associated with a high rate of domestic
   violence.^[76]^[77]^[78]^[79]

   A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are
   married without their freely given consent.^[80] The line between
   forced marriage and consensual marriage may become blurred, because the
   social norms of many cultures dictate that one should never oppose the
   desire of one's parents/relatives in regard to the choice of a spouse;
   in such cultures it is not necessary for violence, threats,
   intimidation etc. to occur, the person simply "consents" to the
   marriage even if he/she doesn't want it, out of the implied social
   pressure and duty. The customs of bride price and dowry, that exist in
   parts of the world, can lead to buying and selling people into
   marriage.^[81]^[82]

   A child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under
   18.^[83]^[84] Child marriage was common throughout history but is today
   condemned by international human rights organizations.^[85]^[86]^[87]
   Child marriages are often arranged between the families of the future
   bride and groom, sometimes as soon as the girl is born.^[85] Child
   marriages can also occur in the context of marriage by abduction.^[85]

The concept of family honor[edit]

   Main article: Family honor
   Further information: Culture of honor and Honor killing

   Family honor is an abstract concept involving the perceived quality of
   worthiness and respectability that affects the social standing and the
   self-evaluation of a group of related people, both corporately and
   individually.^[88]^[89] The family is viewed as the main source of
   honor and the community highly values the relationship between honor
   and the family.^[90] The conduct of family members reflects upon family
   honor and the way the family perceives itself, and is perceived by
   others.^[89] In cultures of honor maintaining the family honor is often
   perceived as more important than either individual freedom, or
   individual achievement.^[91] In extreme cases, engaging in acts that
   are deemed to tarnish the honor of the family results in honor
   killings. An honor killing is the homicide of a member of a family or
   social group by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the
   victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community,
   usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an arranged marriage,
   being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having
   sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways
   which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in homosexual
   relations.^[92]^[93]^[94]^[95]^[96]

Economic issues[edit]

   A family is often part of a sharing economy with common ownership.

Dowry, bride price and dower[edit]

   Main articles: Dowry, Bride price, and Dower
   A traditional, formal presentation of the bride price at a Thai
   engagement ceremony.

   Dowry is property (money, goods, or estate) that a wife or wife's
   family gives to her husband when the wife and husband marry.^[97]
   Offering dowry was common in many cultures historically (including in
   Europe and North America), but this practice today is mostly restricted
   to some areas primarily in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Nepal,
   Bangladesh).

   Bride price, (also bridewealth or bride token), is property paid by the
   groom or his family to the parents of a woman upon the marriage of
   their daughter to the groom. It is practiced mostly in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, parts of South-East Asia (Thailand, Cambodia), and parts of
   Central Asia.

   Dower is property given to the bride herself by the groom at the time
   of marriage, and which remains under her ownership and control.^[98]

Property regimes and taxation[edit]

   In some countries married couples benefit from various taxation
   advantages not available to a single person or to unmarried couples.
   For example, spouses may be allowed to average their combined incomes.
   Some jurisdictions recognize common law marriage or de facto relations
   for this purposes. In some jurisdictions there is also an option of
   civil partnership or domestic partnership.

   Different property regimes exist for spouses. In many countries, each
   marriage partner has the choice of keeping their property separate or
   combining properties. In the latter case, called community property,
   when the marriage ends by divorce each owns half. In lieu of a will or
   trust, property owned by the deceased generally is inherited by the
   surviving spouse.

Size[edit]

   Further information: Fertility factor (demography)
   Mennonite siblings, Montana 1937

   The total fertility rate of women varies from country to country, from
   a high of 6.76 children born/woman in Niger to a low of 0.81 in
   Singapore (as of 2015).^[99] Fertility is low in most Eastern European
   and Southern European countries; and high in most Sub-Saharan African
   countries.^[99]

   In some cultures, the mother's preference of family size influences
   that of the children through early adulthood.^[100] A parent's number
   of children strongly correlates with the number of children that they
   will eventually have.^[101]

Rights and laws[edit]

Reproductive rights[edit]

   Forced sterilization is an example of government authorities coercively
   interfering with reproductive rights. The image shows a "We do not
   stand alone" Nazi poster from 1936 with flags of other countries with
   compulsory sterilization legislation.
   Main article: Reproductive rights
   Further information: Forced sterilization, Forced pregnancy, and Forced
   abortion

   Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to
   reproduction and reproductive health. These include the right to decide
   on issues regarding the number of children born, family planning,
   contraception, and private life, free from coercion and discrimination;
   as well as the right to access health services and adequate
   information.^[102]^[103]^[104]^[105] According to UNFPA, reproductive
   rights "include the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of
   children, the right to voluntarily marry and establish a family, and
   the right to the highest attainable standard of health, among
   others".^[106] Family planning refers to the factors that may be
   considered by individuals and couples in order for them to control
   their fertility, anticipate and attain the desired number of children
   and the spacing and timing of their births.^[107]^[108]

   The state and church have been, and still are in some countries,
   involved in controlling the size of families, often using coercive
   methods, such as bans on contraception and/or abortion (where the
   policy is a natalist one - for example through tax on childlessness) or
   conversely, discriminatory policies against large families or even
   forced abortions (e.g., China's one-child policy in place from 1978 to
   2015). Forced sterilization has often targeted ethnic minority groups,
   such as Roma women in Eastern Europe,^[109]^[110] or indigenous women
   in Peru (during the 1990s).^[111]

Parents' rights[edit]

   The parents' rights movement is a movement whose members are primarily
   interested in issues affecting parents and children related to family
   law, specifically parental rights and obligations. Mothers' rights
   movements focus on maternal health, workplace issues such as labor
   rights, breastfeeding, and rights in family law. The fathers' rights
   movement is a movement whose members are primarily interested in issues
   related to family law, including child custody and child support, that
   affect fathers and their children.^[112]

Children's rights[edit]

   Main article: Children's rights

   Children's rights are the human rights of children, with particular
   attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to
   minors, including their right to association with both parents, their
   right to human identity, their right to be provided in regard to their
   other basic needs, and their right to be free from violence and
   abuse.^[113]^[114]^[115]

Marriage rights[edit]

   Main article: Marriage laws

   Each jurisdiction has its own marriage laws. These laws differ
   significantly from country to country; and these laws are often
   controversial. Areas of controversy include women's rights as well as
   same-sex marriage.

Legal reforms[edit]

   Legal reforms to family laws have taken place in many countries during
   the past few decades. These dealt primarily with gender equality within
   marriage and with divorce laws. Women have been given equal rights in
   marriage in many countries, reversing older family laws based on the
   dominant legal role of the husband. Coverture, which was enshrined in
   the common law of England and the US for several centuries and
   throughout most of the 19th century, was abolished. In some European
   countries the changes that lead to gender equality were slower. The
   period of 1975-1979 saw a major overhaul of family laws in countries
   such as Italy,^[116]^[117] Spain,^[118] Austria,^[119]^[119] West
   Germany,^[120]^[121] and Portugal.^[122] In 1978, the Council of Europe
   passed the Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil
   law.^[123] Among the last European countries to establish full gender
   equality in marriage were Switzerland,^[124] Greece,^[125] Spain,^[126]
   the Netherlands,^[127] and France ^[128] in the 1980s. In recent
   decades, the marital power has also been abolished in African countries
   that had this doctrine, but many African countries that were former
   French colonies still have discriminatory laws in their marriages
   regulations, such regulations originating in the Napoleonic Code that
   has inspired these laws.^[129] In some countries (predominantly Roman
   Catholic) divorce was legalized only recently (e.g. Italy (1970),
   Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987), Ireland
   (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011)) although annulment and legal
   separation were options. Philippines still does not allow divorce. (see
   Divorce law by country). The laws pertaining to the situation of
   children born outside marriage have also been revised in many countries
   (see legitimacy (law)).

Work-family balance[edit]

   Further information: Work–life balance and Work–family balance in the
   United States

   Work-family balance is a concept involving proper prioritizing between
   work/career and family life. It includes issues relating to the way how
   work and families intersect and influence each other. At a political
   level, it is reflected through policies such maternity leave and
   paternity leave. Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as
   feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work
   and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly
   targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.^[130]

   Main article: Family medicine

   Family medicine is a medical specialty devoted to comprehensive health
   care for people of all ages; it is based on knowledge of the patient in
   the context of the family and the community, emphasizing disease
   prevention and health promotion.^[132] The importance of family
   medicine is being increasingly recognized.^[133]

Maternal mortality[edit]

   Main article: Maternal mortality

   Maternal mortality or maternal death is defined by WHO as "the death of
   a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy,
   irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause
   related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not
   from accidental or incidental causes."^[135] Historically, maternal
   mortality was a major cause of women's death. In recent decades,
   advances in healthcare have resulted in rates of maternal mortality
   having dropped dramatically, especially in Western countries. Maternal
   mortality however remains a serious problem in many African and Asian
   counties.^[135]^[136]

Infant and child mortality[edit]

   Main articles: Infant mortality and Child mortality

   Infant mortality is the death of a child less than one year of age.
   Child mortality is the death of a child before the child's fifth
   birthday. Like maternal mortality, infant and child mortality were
   common throughout history, but have decreased significantly in modern
   times.^[137]^[138]

Politics[edit]

   Family policies differ significantly between countries. Depending on
   jurisdiction, family policy may have a multiplicity of functions:
   horizontal redistribution, the enhancement of individual choices,
   increasing fertility rates, supporting economic growth and
   productivity, as well as reducing gender inequalities (Ferragina and
   Seeleib-Kaiser 2015).^[139] From a societal perspective, family
   policies can contribute to "horizontal redistribution" between
   generations, as well as between households with and without children;
   to favour individual choices by supporting the reconciliation between
   care and paid work; and to reduce the costs of having children and
   child poverty. From an economic perspective, employment-oriented family
   policy is part of an overall redesign of welfare states geared to
   foster "active citizenship", also among mothers who were formerly not
   employed, through the development of an "enabling state". More generous
   family policies are said to lead to higher employment rates for women,
   mitigate the risk of unemployment for mothers after a substantial
   period of leave, support a social investment strategy, and offset some
   of the costs of raising children. From many feminist perspectives,
   family policies should aim at equalising opportunities between men and
   women through de-familialising care, encouraging men's involvement in
   care work, and facilitating employment opportunities for women.
   Profound social, economic, and cultural changes have led in many
   societies to the decline of the "male breadwinner model" and the move
   towards a variety of "adult worker models" (Daly 2011). Nevertheless,
   family policy expansion has not always fundamentally challenged gender
   inequalities: overall men have not increased their contribution to care
   work sufficiently to "compensate" for women's increased labour force
   participation and slightly reduced participation in care.

   In an era of perceived permanent austerity and overall welfare state
   retrenchment, rich OECD countries have not been prevented from
   expanding family policies (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2015).^[139] In
   fact, in many of these countries there has been an expansion of family
   policies, leading to a socialisation of family care responsibilities,
   traditionally disproportionately performed by women (Daly and Lewis
   2000). Although at the institutional policy level, the expansion of
   family policy might be characterised as a "silent revolution", relevant
   for gender equality, a cautious interpretation might be necessary:
   gender inequalities in income, opportunities, leisure and other
   significant outcomes remain and are sometimes sustained by policy, even
   if there is an observed shift in their character towards support for
   women's employment (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2015).

   The policy shift has been particularly significant in countries that
   had previously emphasised more conservative approaches to family
   policies, such as Germany, Ireland, Japan, and Norway. Hence, it can no
   longer be assumed that in the majority of rich OECD countries care for
   young children will be mainly provided through unpaid work within the
   family. Nevertheless, a certain number of countries still fail to
   provide adequate childcare arrangements, constituting a barrier for
   full-time maternal employment. Furthermore, in some countries, such as
   the United States and the United Kingdom, gender discrimination
   continues to strongly intersect with class; high childcare costs
   constitute a disincentive to labour force participation, especially
   among less educated and unskilled women (Esping-Andersen 2009). This
   means that higher-class and more educated women tend to have better
   opportunities than women belonging to a lower social class.

   Partisanship and women's political agency have been the main drivers
   for family policy change during the 1980s and 1990s in many countries.
   For the 2000s, however, the importance of these drivers has
   significantly declined. As societal preferences have undergone profound
   changes — to some extent driven by the activities of women's equality
   movements, as well as by the experience of women's employment — the
   policy preferences of voters have also changed. Electorates in western
   democracies increasingly want policies supporting "modern" family
   lifestyles which depend on women's employment (Ferragina and
   Seeleib-Kaiser 2015). As political parties react to these changed
   policy preferences, the traditional differences in family policy
   positions between political parties decline. The extent to which this
   translates into support for gender equality, and how such equality
   might be defined, is as yet not decided. However, societal policy
   preferences, long believed to be set in stone, are undergoing profound
   changes; and public opinion increasingly matters for changing policies.
   The changed policy preferences are also mirrored in new political
   discourses that prioritise social investment and the preservation of
   the human capital of women, especially of those who are highly skilled.
   The expansion of family policies geared to supporting women's
   employment and investment in children is very likely to continue in
   western democracies.(Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2015).^[139]

   While in many parts of the world family policies seek to promote a
   gender-equal organization of the family life, in others the
   male-dominated family continues to be the official policy of the
   authorities, which is also supported by law. For instance, the Civil
   Code of Iran states at Article 1105: "In relations between husband and
   wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of
   the husband".^[140]

   In some parts of the world, some governments promote a specific form of
   family, such as that based on traditional family values. The term
   'family values' is often used in political discourse in some countries,
   its general meaning being that of traditional or cultural values that
   pertain to the family's structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes,
   and ideals, usually involving the "traditional family" - a middle-class
   family with a breadwinner father and a homemaker mother, raising their
   biological children. Any deviation from this family model is considered
   a "nontraditional family".^[141] These family ideals are often advanced
   through policies such as marriage promotion. Some jurisdictions outlaw
   practices which they deem as socially or religiously unacceptable, such
   as fornication, cohabitation or adultery.

Protection of private and family life[edit]

   Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides a right
   to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his
   correspondence", subject to certain restrictions that are "in
   accordance with law" and "necessary in a democratic society".^[142]
   “ Article 8 – Right to respect for private and family life

     1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
     his home and his correspondence.

     2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
     exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and
     is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national
     security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for
     the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or
     morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
                                                                            ”

Criticism[edit]

   Certain social scientists have advocated the abolition of the family.
   An early opponent of the family was Socrates whose position was
   outlined by Plato in The Republic.^[143] In Book 5 of The Republic,
   Socrates tells his interlocutors that a just city is one in which
   citizens have no family ties.^[144]^[145]

   The family being such a deep-rooted and much-venerated institution, few
   intellectuals have ventured to speak against it. Familialism has been
   atypically defined as a “social structure where … a family's values are
   held in higher esteem than the values of the individual members of the
   family.”^[146] Favoritism granted to relatives regardless of merit is
   called nepotism.

   The Russian-American rationalist and individualist philosopher,
   novelist and playwright Ayn Rand compared partiality towards
   consanguinity with racism, as a small-scale manifestation of the
   latter.^[147] “The worship of the family is merely racism, like a
   crudely primitive first installment on the worship of the tribe. It
   places the accident of birth above a man's values and duty to the tribe
   above a man's right to his own life.”^[148] Additionally, she spoke in
   favor of childfree lifestyle, while following it herself.^[147]

   The British social critic, poet, mountaineer and occultist Aleister
   Crowley censured the institution of family in his works: “Horrid word,
   family! Its very etymology accuses it of servility and stagnation. /
   Latin, famulus, a servant; Oscan, Faamat, he dwells. … [T]hink what
   horrid images it evokes from the mind. Not only Victorian; wherever the
   family has been strong, it has always been an engine of tyranny. Weak
   members or weak neighbours: it is the mob spirit crushing genius, or
   overwhelming opposition by brute arithmetic. … In every Magical, or
   similar system, it is invariably the first condition which the Aspirant
   must fulfill: he must once and for all and for ever put his family
   outside his magical circle.”^[149]

   The American journalist Marty Nemko considers family to be overrated.
   “Politicians, clerics, and just plain folks extol family as our most
   important institution. / I believe family is overrated. So many people
   suffer inordinately from family. … / Millions of people don't even
   speak with a family member. Millions more spend years and fortunes on
   therapists, trying to undo the ills that family perpetrated on them. /
   All this shouldn’t be surprising. After all, unlike with friends, we
   are placed in our family of origin at random, with no say in the
   matter.”^[150]

The family and social justice[edit]

   One of the controversies regarding the family is the application of the
   concept of social justice to the private sphere of family relations, in
   particular with regard to the rights of women and children. Throughout
   much of the history, most philosophers who advocated for social justice
   focused on the public political arena, not on the family structures;
   with the family often being seen as a separate entity which needed to
   be protected from outside state intrusion. One notable exception was
   John Stuart Mill, who, in his work The Subjection of Women, advocated
   for greater rights for women within marriage and family.^[151] Second
   wave feminists argued that the personal is political, stating that
   there are strong connections between personal experiences and the
   larger social and political structures. In the context of the feminist
   movement of the 1960s and 1970s, this was a challenge to the nuclear
   family and family values, as they were understood then.^[152] Feminists
   focused on domestic violence, arguing that the reluctance - in law or
   in practice - of the state to intervene and offer protection to women
   who have been abused within the family, is in violation of women's
   human rights, and is the result of an ideology which places family
   relations outside the conceptual framework of human rights.^[153]
