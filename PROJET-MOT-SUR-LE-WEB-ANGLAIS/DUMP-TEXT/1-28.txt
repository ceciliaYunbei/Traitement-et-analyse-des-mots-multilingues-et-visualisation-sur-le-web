   REFOCUS by Gerard Veldhoven
   The word love and the term family should be united in definition.
   Tradition dictates to us that a family consists of a father, mother and
   at least one child.

   Love, as we discover through living our existence, is a phenomenon
   second to none and people cherish the moments as one unites with the
   person of one’s choice, regardless of sexual orientation.

   This we were told was an unaccepted, formed family unit and that meant
   the traditional nucleus must be maintained because religious and other
   authorities tell us so. After all, that is what the Bible says we must
   do.

   As we know, and with the advent of inclusive thinking and nature’s
   wonderful gift of the natural progression of falling in love, we are
   now in a world of a more accepting society where we all have the right
   for a happy existence. We fall in love with the person of our own
   individual choice rather than accept the person that is the perfect one
   according to parents and friends. We choose on the basis of our own
   inner feelings.

   The number of those who constitute a “family” is no longer an issue as
   in the past. In Canada we learn, as in many western nations, that those
   who choose a partner who is compatible and one who is our chosen mate
   in love, are no less an accepted unit than any other. From the moment
   we are born, our parents and others instil the thoughts in our minds
   that at some point we meet someone, of course of the opposite sex, to
   have children, because our parents wish to be grandparents. That was a
   given.

   Today, that thought persists, but to a much lesser extent.

   The word “family” is usually defined as parents and their children,
   however, in our more inclusive world we now recognize family as those
   who are cohabitating, with or without offspring, or indeed living
   separately and are committed to each other and therefore a family unit.
   Sometimes living together is not an option, but nevertheless a true
   love keeps the relationship intact.  Love is not confined to a certain
   situation or place, but survives because of commitment, regardless of
   sexual orientation, gender, type of family nucleus, or simply defining
   their love as family.

   Times have changed dramatically and the fact members of our society are
   able to express love as they feel it is of profound importance. Love is
   the inner feelings for another and we must celebrate that and respect
   the outcome as a positive. Marriage is not the only family unit.

   Religious institutions, for the most part, speak out against such
   situations and insist on marriage. The great news is that people who
   find love also become a family, perhaps not in the traditional sense,
   but nevertheless with the same intent in that love makes them equal.

   This will remain a serious issue for some and frowned upon, dismissed
   as morally wrong, but love prevails and that is the end result. Love
   equals family and love is all it takes to be a family.
