Europeans campaign for one million signatures backing natural family

   european union , mum, dad, & kids , same-sex 'marriage'

   BRUSSELS, April 28, 2016 (LifeSiteNews) – A coalition of Christian and
   pro-family groups in seven countries, calling itself “Mum, Dad & Kids,”
   is campaigning to gather one million signatures across Europe to get
   the European Union to consider legislation establishing the natural
   definition of the family and marriage.

   Groups such as Hungary’s Emberi Méltóság Központ, and France’s La Manif
   pour Tous, and others in Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Portugal,
   Slovakia, and Germany are jointly campaigning for the necessary one
   million signatures to propose legislation to the European Commission,
   the EU’s executive. The commission can choose to put the bill before
   the European Parliament or not.  The group has until December 11 to
   marshal its support.

   The proposal argues that the law is needed because the institution of
   the family is being eroded by social forces at the same time as its
   meaning is being muddied by new EU laws defining it to include people
   in “a committed relationship in a joint household”—covering both same
   sex relationships and unmarried heterosexual ones.

   This is not good enough, the organizers say. They want “marriage” to
   mean “solely a permanent and life-long union between one man and one
   woman” and “family” to mean only the married couple, “their common
   progeny and their direct descendants.”

   The coalition argues that marriage has existed as a legal entity with
   special protection because it has a clear benefit for the common good,
   the bearing and rearing of children.

   Parents who merely have produced a child but form no relationship
   together to raise her are not in a family, the coalition contends. Nor
   does the existence of “sentiments of love” between two adults make them
   a family unless they “freely express” their will to “found a family.”

   The proposed law does not force individual countries to accept the
   coalition’s definition of marriage. But it does apply one definition to
   all European Union legislation and rescinds recent efforts to sneak in
   definitions that implicitly include homosexual couples.

   It would also set up a legal firewall so that what is accepted as a
   family in one country cannot be forced onto another country. Therefore,
   if one country accepts and ratifies polygamous marriages, and one such
   family moved to another country that did not accept that definition,
   the second country would not be required to recognize or enforce
   spousal support for more than one wife.

   In the U.S. before the Supreme Court made same-sex “marriage” legal,
   many states which did not recognize same-sex “marriage” were
   nevertheless forced by judges to accept them when performed in other
   states that did.

   The European Commission has recently considered three initiatives. One
   called for a halt to experimentation on animals; another, for a halt to
   experimentation on human embryos; and a third called for a recognition
   of a human right to drinking water. The commission refused to let any
   of them come to a vote in the Parliament.
