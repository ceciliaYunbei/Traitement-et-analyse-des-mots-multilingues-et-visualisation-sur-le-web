The Changing American Family – from New York Times

   By Amy on November 26, 2013 in Family, In The News, Other Research,
   Research

   The New York Times just published a special section of their Science
   Times entitled The Changing American Family. And in the category of
   disappointing but not surprising, nary a partnered childfree family is
   to be found.

   Author Natalie Angier notes that the American family “has become as
   multilayered and full of surprises as a holiday turducken” yet
   apparently those many layers do not include partnered families without
   children. While the article does note the increase in single “families
   of one” and families that include “good friends” who are part of the
   “’’voluntary kin’ movement,” couples without kids appear to be the only
   category that don’t seem to count enough as “families” that they
   warrant inclusion in the 28-page piece.

   At one point, the article does mention that our nation’s birthrate is
   at an all-time low but, oddly, it doesn’t consider how adults with
   partners but without kids form family. It also only mentions families
   of one in passing; none of the families featured in the piece are
   childfree nor are any of them childless.

   Thus while the article charts the demographic changes in the family
   landscape across the U.S. quite thoroughly, the families interviewed
   for the piece do not represent the diverse trends described.

The Changing American Family

   American households have never been more diverse, more surprising, more
   baffling. In this special issue of Science Times, NATALIE ANGIER takes
   stock of our changing definition of family.

   time.David Walter Banks for The New York Times.

   CHELSEA, MICH. — Kristi and Michael Burns have a lot in common. They
   love crossword puzzles, football, going to museums and reading five or
   six books at a time. They describe themselves as mild-mannered
   introverts who suffer from an array of chronic medical problems. The
   two share similar marital résumés, too. On their wedding day in 2011,
   the groom was 43 years old and the bride 39, yet it was marriage No. 3
   for both.

   Today, their blended family is a sprawling, sometimes uneasy ensemble
   of two sharp-eyed sons from her two previous husbands, a daughter and
   son from his second marriage, ex-spouses of varying degrees of
   involvement, the partners of ex-spouses, the bemused in-laws and a
   kitten named Agnes that likes to sleep on computer keyboards.

   Today, their blended family is a sprawling, sometimes uneasy ensemble

   son from his second marriage, ex-spouses of varying degrees of
   involvement, the partners of ex-spouses, the bemused in-laws and a
   kitten named Agnes that likes to sleep on computer keyboards.

   If the Burnses seem atypical as an American nuclear family, how about
   the Schulte-Waysers, a merry band of two married dads, six kids and two
   dogs? Or the Indrakrishnans, a successful immigrant couple in Atlanta
   whose teenage daughter divides her time between prosaic homework and
   the precision footwork of ancient Hindu dance; the Glusacs of Los
   Angeles, with their two nearly grown children and their litany of
   middle-class challenges that seem like minor sagas; Ana Perez and
   Julian Hill of Harlem, unmarried and just getting by, but with Warren
   Buffett-size dreams for their three young children; and the alarming
   number of families with incarcerated parents, a sorry byproduct of
   America’s status as the world’s leading jailer.

   The typical American family, if it ever lived anywhere but on Norman
   Rockwell’s Thanksgiving canvas, has become as multilayered and full of
   surprises as a holiday turducken — the all-American seasonal
   portmanteau of deboned turkey, duck and chicken.

   Researchers who study the structure and evolution of the American
   family express unsullied astonishment at how rapidly the family has
   changed in recent years, the transformations often exceeding or
   capsizing those same experts’ predictions of just a few journal
   articles ago.
