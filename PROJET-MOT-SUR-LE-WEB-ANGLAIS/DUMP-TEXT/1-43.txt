The Conservative Definition of 'Family Values' Is B.S.

   Two advocates launch an initiative to push back against nuclear family
   privilege.

   The term “family values,” particularly when used in election years, is
   rarely about what really matters to children and families. Instead the
   phrase serves to indict those who don’t live in traditional nuclear
   American homes—despite the fact that the “Leave it to Beaver” family
   model, with a stay-at-home mom and working dad, is no longer an
   accurate representation of how families across the country look.

   In a recent piece for Salon, family advocates Mia Birdsong and Nicole
   Rodgers note that at “its peak in the late 1950s, 65 percent of
   children were living in this type of...family unit. Today, it’s just 22
   percent.” Fed up with all the negative representations of non-nuclear
   families they encountered, the two decided to launch a new initiative
   called Family Story to change the way we talk about what family
   means. “[I]t’s past time that we take back the conservative claim to
   family” the Family Story website states. The organization is focused on
   countering the idea that there is a single “right” kind of family.

   Conservatives constantly bemoan changes in the American family
   structure as proof of moral failing, and they have long vilified
   families with working mothers, single parents, LGBT parents, and
   non-parental caregivers. But these types of families defy conservative
   stereotypes and outdated stigmas. Family Story, which allows real
   families to tell their own stories via powerful videos and other media,
   will push back against these pathologizing narratives.

   “I hate that ‘family values’ has become a meaningless term often tossed
   around by social conservatives, while all around us there are families
   living truly important values of love, support and connectedness who
   are left out,” Rodgers says. “I decided it was time to burn the old
   paradigm down and build something authentic and meaningful in its
   ashes.”

   Family Story’s mission is ambitious yet necessary. The project “will
   develop new research, share aspirational narratives and highlight the
   innovative and compelling ideas, practices, and solutions that families
   and communities have developed. We will offer inspiring models for new
   American dreams. We will push back against harmful stereotypes and
   cultural stigma. We will separate social problems like poverty,
   violence, and poor school performance from family structure, and
   contest the myth that the nuclear family is the solution to these
   challenges.”

   Rodgers is the founder of Role Reboot, a popular website that takes an
   incisive look at issues around family, gender, culture and “life off
   script.” Before founding and becoming co-director of Family Story, she
   spent years researching data proving that traditional families are not
   the panacea conservatives claim. Rodgers included some of this data in
   an article titled “Marriage Is No Safeguard Against Poverty” which was
   featured in the Washington Post this March.

   Earlier this year, Mia Birdsong delivered an astonishing TED Talk that
   countered damaging, long-held ideas about poor people; it has since
   been viewed more than 700,000 times. Prio to becoming Family Story
   co-director, she served as vice president of the Family Independence
   Initiative, an anti-poverty nonprofit.

   “Family Story is not, and will never be, about bashing nuclear
   families,” Nicole Rodgers says. “Two married parents raising children
   can be a wonderful thing; it’s just not the best or only thing. This is
   about building a bigger tent and respecting the dignity and value of a
   wider range of family arrangements.”

   “It’s no surprise that conservatives have such limited, regressive
   views on what makes a ‘good’ family,” adds Birdsong. “But too few
   progressive advocates, policymakers and pundits are offering a
   counter-narrative. There are incredible, beautiful families who have
   figured out how to make it work outside the nuclear family model. It’s
   past time we lift up their stories.”
