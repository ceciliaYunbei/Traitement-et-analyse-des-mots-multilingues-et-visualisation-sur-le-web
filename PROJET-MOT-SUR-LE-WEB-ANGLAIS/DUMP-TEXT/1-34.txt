   What Is ‘Family’? High School Test Question Redefines Definition,

What Is ‘Family’? High School Test Question Redefines Definition, Counts This
Student’s Answer Wrong

   Tara West

   A seemingly innocent question on a high school student’s health test
   has caused a stir on social media. The test asks a multiple choice
   question asking for the definition of “family.” The student chose what
   he felt was the most accurate answer provided in the five multiple
   choices, but was docked five points for an “incorrect” answer. The
   student took a photo of his answer and what the school deemed to be the
   “correct” answer and showed it to his father. The father then posted
   the image to Twitter, questioning if the “correct” answer is correct at
   all.

   The Blaze reported on an interesting multiple choice test question
   given to a high school student on a health exam. The question was
   overly basic, simply asking for the definition of family. However,
   there was one problem: The actual definition of family was not one of
   the multiple choice answers. Instead, the student saw the answers
   below.

     My son was marked down 5 percent on a high school health test
     because he chose this “incorrect” definition of family.

   Will Saletan’s son chose the answer, “a collection of blood-related
   individuals living together” as the most accurate. However, the answer
   was counted wrong and five points were docked from his test score. The
   correct answer, according to the test answer key, was “a collection of
   individuals who care for and about each other.” So which definition is
   more accurate?

   One astute commenter points out that none of the five choices are
   correct as they do not fall in line with any of the major dictionaries’
   definitions. Here are the definitions of family, according to five
   different dictionaries.
     * Merriam-Webster: “a group of people who are related to each other”
     * Cambridge dictionary: “a social group of parents, children, and
       sometimes grandparents, uncles, aunts, and others who are related”
     * Wiktionary: “A group of people who are closely related to one
       another (by blood, marriage or adoption)”
     * Dictionary.com: “A basic social unit consisting of parents and
       their children, considered as a group, whether dwelling together or
       not”

   Going down the line, it seems that the student’s answer was more
   closely tied with dictionary definition of family than the test key
   answer.

   What do you think? Was the “correct” test answer or the student’s test
   answer closer to the actual definition of family? Should the test
   question be amended?
