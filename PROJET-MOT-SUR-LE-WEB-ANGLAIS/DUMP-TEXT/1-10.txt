Bill Shorten Wants To Do Away With Our '50s Definition Of Family

"I think what parents don't need is the judgment of others."

   Bill Shorten and his daughter Clementine.

   Bill Shorten opened up about how his experience of being a stepfather
   has shaped his views on family while appearing on the ABC's Kitchen
   Cabinet on Wednesday night.

   The episode was aired after Shorten was criticised on Wednesday morning
   when The Australian published footage of him telling an Australian
   Christian Lobby forum three years ago that he was "completely relaxed
   about having some form of plebiscite" on same-sex marriage.

   However, he has since admitted that he's had a change of heart,
   claiming it had been a stitch up so that Malcolm Turnbull "could get
   some avid conservatives to vote for him in the internal civil wars of
   the liberal party".

   During his relaxed chat with host Annabel Crabb, Shorten advocated for
   changing the views of Australians when it comes to what makes a family.

   "This 1950s definition of what constitutes a family, I don't think that
   describes not just gay couples with kids but I don't think it describes
   blended families," he told Crabb.

     I think what parents don't need is the judgment of others

   "I don't think it captures single-parent families. You know that old
   saying, 'it takes a village to raise a child'? There's a lot of truth
   to that.

   "One of the reasons why I support marriage equality is that
   same-sex-attracted couples who love each other and have kids, why
   should their kids somehow feel invalidated or that somehow their
   parents, their carers, that their relationships are any less valuable
   or wanted?"

   Shorten said that being a stepfather has made him realise that
   politicians should be working to enable people to live their lives
   without fear or prejudice, further cementing his position against a
   same-sex marriage plebiscite.

   The Opposition Leader married Chloe Bryce, the daughter of former
   Governor General Quentin Bryce, in 2009 and has one child with her,
   Clementine. Chloe has two children from a previous marriage, Georgette
   and Rupert.

   "The experience of being a father, of being a stepfather, has opened my
   eyes that people's relationships don't need opinion polls from other
   people," he said.

   "The job of government is to help create the right economic
   circumstances, you know, do the right things in education, health care,
   enable people's lives. It's not to stand in some sort of moral
   judgment.

   "I think what parents don't need is the judgment of others."
