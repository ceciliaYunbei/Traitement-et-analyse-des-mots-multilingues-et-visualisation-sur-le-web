                        The Changing American Family

               Dramatic changes in the shape of U.S. families
         have left us with old policies in a world of new realities

   As we head into the 21st century, changes within and among families in
   the U.S. are striking at the heart of our notions about life and the
   way it functions. Such things as longer life spans, the advent of safe
   and effective birth control, women’s increasing participation in the
   paid labor force, and a dramatic increase in divorce rates are
   reshaping family life in the late 20th century. The new realities of
   family life are in sharp contrast with idealized notions of the family
   that have developed over centuries. Conflicts in the way we perceive
   the family are creating profound contradictions in public policy. If
   the family is to be a healthy component in society, as it must be for
   society to survive, we need to understand anew what family is and what
   it is becoming.

THE CHANGING FAMILY

   The range of variation in "families" throughout history and across
   cultures is enormous. Nevertheless, there are certain major themes
   within all this variation: Families are a set of primary relationships
   – biological, emotional, social, economic, and legal. Families are also
   a collection of individuals with differing needs and concerns living in
   complicated relationships with each other and with society. Families
   generally are expected to provide their members mutual economic,
   physical, and emotional support, meeting the human needs for food,
   shelter, and intimacy. Families also carry on tradition and culture
   and, in some instances, pass on property to the next generation.

   If our discussions of families began from this broad understanding, we
   would have a useful starting point. Unfortunately, many discussions
   about families, and much of our policy and literature, assume a much
   more narrow definition of a "normal" family: a caretaking mother,
   breadwinning father, and one or more minor children. Many of today’s
   senior citizens formed such families and many middle-aged adults grew
   up in them, but the composition and characteristics of families have
   changed considerably since World War II, especially in the last two
   decades. Although close to 75% of U.S. citizens still live in
   family-based households (see figure below):
     * Only 9% of U.S. households fit that old definition of the "normal"
       family.
     * A majority of families have no children under age 18.
     * More than 25% of all families with children are single parent
       families; almost all of these have a female head of the household.
     * 72% of women in the child-bearing years are employed. By 1995,
       labor force statisticians predict the proportion will increase to
       81%.
     * Out of wedlock births (often by older women) are now about 20% of
       all births and virtually all such children are kept by the mother
       rather than put up for adoption.
     * For the first time, the U.S. is generationally top-heavy: there are
       more grandparents than grandchildren.



THE CHANGING WORKFORCE

   A major factor affecting all these statistics has been the steady shift
   of women into the paid labor force. This profound shift has happened
   within a single human lifespan, too fast for many of our institutions
   and attitudes to keep pace. A large number of today’s older senior
   citizen women have been dependent housewives for most of their adult
   lives. They were raised expecting to find a husband who could support
   them, and for a majority of this generation the breadwinning
   husband/caretaking wife model worked.

   Their daughters were often employed before their marriage and until
   they had children. After the children were in school, many reentered
   the workforce, demonstrating that their involvement in the workforce
   was not a temporary aberration. In 1965, 41.1% of women aged 35-44 were
   in the paid labor force. Twenty-one years later this same cohort of
   women (now 55-64 years old) were represented in almost the same
   proportion, 42.3%. (An interesting question is to what extent these
   were the same women being employed or whether individual women moved in
   and out of the labor force depending on family circumstances.)

   The younger sisters of this age cohort followed their elders’ example
   and added momentum to the trend. In 1965, 38.5% of women aged 25-34
   were in the paid labor force. By 1986 this same group – then aged 45-55
   – had a 66.3% rate. These women were obviously more dedicated to paid
   employment than is commonly believed, but society still maintained the
   fiction that women were caretakers and men were breadwinners.

   What’s interesting – but not often perceived or discussed – is that as
   women’s employment has increased, men’s employment has decreased.
   During the last 25 years women’s employment has increased by 30% or
   more in every age category up to age 55 while men’s employment has
   declined in every age group over age 25. This trend represents a
   profound shift in lifestyles and contradicts long-held cultural
   assumptions.

FORCES BEHIND THE CHANGE

   There are strong economic forces at work behind this shift. For a great
   majority of younger families, it is no longer practical to think in
   terms of a "family wage" – enough income from one wage earner to
   support a family, the children’s education and the couple’s retirement.
   Virtually every younger family (and many older ones) now assumes that
   the wife and mother can – and must – be an economic contributor to the
   family.

   Family income has dropped over the last decade and a half, unless there
   is a second earner. In February, 1988, the Congressional Budget Office
   released a report: "Trends in Family Income: 1970-1986." Staff of the
   U.S. House of Representatives’ Select Committee on Children, Youth and
   Families analyzed these findings and concluded that although "family
   income for the typical family rose during this period … income gains
   were not evenly distributed. Low income families with children, young
   families at all income levels and poor single mother families in 1986
   were much worse off than their counterparts in 1970." The main reason
   family incomes rose was "the increased number of workers per family,
   not increased earnings by the typical worker. Many families with
   children have needed to have both parents work to avoid losing ground."

   By contrast, among "elderly unrelated individuals and elderly families
   without children, median family income rose 50%." Noting that "earnings
   failed to keep pace with inflation for many workers, especially those
   in the younger age groups," the analysts found that "adding a second
   earner to the workforce or increasing the second earner’s work hours
   was often necessary to keep family income from falling…. These altered
   work arrangements have resulted in parents (especially mothers) having
   less time with children, less leisure time, and possibly, fewer
   children." (italics added).

   Even if the family wage concept were an actuality, the incidence of
   divorce (and the record of support and maintenance awards and payments
   after divorce) indicate to women of all ages that there are no public
   or private guarantees of economic support in exchange for carrying out
   the caretaker role. Paid employment outside the home is now the
   accepted form of self-insurance for women as well as men. Fringe
   benefits such as health insurance and social security are an almost
   mandatory element of self-sufficiency when increasing life spans are
   taken into account.

   Yet while women have moved into the paid workforce in such numbers that
   employment is no longer gender-based, the care and maintenance of
   household and children generally has remained the province of women.
   The physical and emotional work of maintaining families, especially
   those with young children (who require years of almost constant
   supervision and nurture), is very demanding, but it is only just
   beginning to be appreciated by policy makers and society at large.

   The changing relationship to work is also changing the pattern of
   rights and expectations within marriage. Despite strong cultural
   traditions and the need of most humans for intimate relationships, it
   is increasingly clear that individuals who are required to be
   economically self-sufficient have less tolerance for unequal familial
   relationships than those who are economically dependent. As women’s
   attachment to the paid labor force grows stronger, they are asserting
   their rights to power and control in family decision-making more
   vigorously. When those rights are not respected, many women either do
   not enter into, or depart from, what they consider intolerable family
   relationships. Men do the same.

   The questions raised by these shifts are profound and disturbing. Can
   we still rely on families, as we have in the past, to produce healthy
   and effective workers and citizens when it often takes two earners to
   support a young family? Where will the time and effort for family life
   come from? Even more so for the 27% of U.S. families with children and
   only one adult, most often a mother: where does the time, energy and
   money come from to raise those children? According to 1987 Census
   reports, 20% of U.S. children lived in poverty in 1986 (up from 1978),
   with children under age six most at risk. A majority – 51.4% – of
   families below the poverty line were female-headed, illustrating the
   difficulties posed when women alone try to maintain families, assuming
   both the caretaking and breadwinning roles.

   In response to these shifts, will increasing numbers of young women
   reject marriage or motherhood, the creation of new families, because of
   their desire and ability to gain better security and status through
   paid employment? Will those who have little hope or expectation of paid
   employment be the major procreators? Or will standards and norms about
   work and family change? Will men share the caretaking and household
   maintenance functions as women share the breadwinning function? Will
   women give up control inside the household? Who will care for and
   nurture the young as both men and women work for pay? Will society, to
   preserve and regenerate itself, devise ways to help care for the
   vulnerable young as they have for the vulnerable old?

THE CHALLENGE AHEAD

   As the 21st century approaches, the time and energy required for child
   bearing and rearing, the importance of intimate relationships, and the
   need for family policies that take into account the diversity and
   changing nature of American families will need to be increasingly
   understood and appreciated if our society is to survive. Caretaking for
   the next generation can no longer be assumed to be a "free good" with
   the costs borne almost solely by individual parents or families.

   Child bearing is now an option. That option must be made more
   attractive and less expensive to the individual and to families, or
   additional numbers of women and families will limit their child
   bearing. We must also face the reality that human young are vulnerable
   for years, and that effective child rearing is mandatory for a humane
   society. Lip service does not buy groceries or assure a child’s
   development into a competent and satisfied adult. A new social compact
   between men and women, between rich and poor, between generations, and
   between society and the family will need to be devised. The elements of
   that compact are still unclear; what is clear is that women are in the
   paid labor force to stay, at least for a major portion of their adult
   lives.

   Some steps have already been taken or are being discussed; for example,
   maternity and paternity leave, child care subsidies or tax credits,
   extra tax deductions for families with children, and the quality of
   education have been put on the public agenda. There are signs of a new
   generation of "working fathers" – men deeply involved with their
   children, caring for them as mothers have always done – and even
   "househusbands." Such men are still rare enough, however, to be
   remarkable; and unfortunately they are often ostracized.

   What is also remarkable is the resistance among many women to giving up
   control of the caretaking role in families. Even though women’s work in
   the home has been demeaned, the home was still the "province of women"
   where they had a measure of power, some social value, and often a sense
   of satisfaction. An important question for the future is whether women
   will be willing to give up control in the home in order to gain greater
   power in the workplace and the public arena.

   In the next century the child-bearing and child-rearing years may well
   be considered as valued a time of life as the retirement years. It is
   possible that workers who are the parents of young children may be
   encouraged to take a kind of sabbatical, dividing their time between
   family care, part-time employment, and further education or training.
   Parents of young children may be allowed and encouraged to collect some
   of their social security during the regenerative years.

   The work week may be shortened and employment patterns over a lifetime
   may continue to change for both males and females to accommodate
   changes in family circumstances. Health care support for the young and
   their parents may become as accepted as Medicare and public education.
   As people live longer, patterns of living, working, and thinking about
   one’s lifetime will continue to change. More men may find diversity in
   work and family life as satisfying and challenging as have some of the
   current generation of mothers and grandmothers. Equality between men
   and women, once tasted and experimented with, may be appreciated and
   even savored.

   We may understand and acknowledge the fact that raising a child and
   participating in family life breeds wisdom and satisfaction. Caretaking
   also teaches skills like management, prioritizing, and negotiation that
   are transferable and might be rewarded in the future, or at least
   valued. As family life and children – the future incarnate – become
   more fully appreciated, new concepts of success may emerge that equate
   the successful raising of children with career achievement.

   People of all shades of the political and racial spectrum live in
   families. Let us hope that we can use this common ground on behalf of
   families and children as a basis for new social innovations in the 21st
   century comparable to the technological advances of the 20th century.
