   Defining Family
   When most people think of the word family mother, father, children, and
   relatives immediately come to mind. If you look up the word in the
   Merriam-Webster dictionary you would read:

     fam·i·ly (făm'ə-lē, făm'lē) n. - a group of individuals living under
     one roof and usually under one head

   While all this can be true of a family, it is not the only way or the
   correct way that family can be defined. Family is more accurately
   described as a group of people who might not be related by blood or
   marriage but who sincerely care and love each other. Family is there
   for you every step of the way and provides support you could never get
   anywhere else.
   Families are the building blocks of any society and have been this way
   since the beginning. Almost every aspect of our lives involves the term
   family. In our religion we are part of a “family” of believers. At Penn
   State we are part of one big “family” of students and faculty. Our
   country looks up to one person and is united under this man as a
   “family”. While these examples might be accepted by society today, it
   only describes family in broad terms. Family is much deeper than all of
   that and is the love you share with your friends and relatives.
   One very common misconception about family is that its members have to
   be related by blood, marriage, or adoption. In truth, family is anyone
   you love and care about and who also feel the same way about you.
   Johann Schiller described family perfectly when he said; “It is not
   flesh and blood but the heart which makes us fathers and sons.” I
   believe that my family is not only my parents who raised me, my little
   brother and my other relatives, but also my best friends. My great-aunt
   is my blood relative but she knows as much about me as the next person.
   My friend Caitlin can tell you anything you would ever want to know
   regarding me and we can practically read each other’s mind. I am not
   saying that my great-aunt is nothing but Caitlin is just as much a part
   of my family as my aunt. Family goes hand-in-hand with friendship. In
   order to have a family you need friendship. My family and I do not get
   along just because we are forced to live together. My family is my best
   friends and we get along because we genuinely love each other and want
   to be with each other.
   In today’s society most people consider family to be just blood
   relations but in reality it is the bonds you share with those you care
   for the most. Family is a completely necessary part of anyone’s life.
   Your family helps you through the tough times and provides the needed
   support to get through life. Family cares about what happens to you,
   are always there for you, and above all, loves you.

   Hi Ler5018,
   I like this piece. The only thing I see is that you haven't taken the
   time to explain why Merriam-Webster's definition is off. You basically
   dismiss that definition offhand and expect your readers to buy yours.
   Just my two cents though. Emotion: smile

   need the word?) or the correct way that family can be defined. Family
   is more accurately described as a group of people who might not be
   related by blood or marriage but who sincerely care and love each
   other. Family is there for you every step of the way and provides

   One very common misconception about family is that its members have to
   be related by blood, marriage, or adoption. In truth, family is anyone
   you love and care about and who also feel (agreement) the same way
   about you. Johann Schiller described family perfectly when he said; “It
   is not flesh and blood but the heart which makes us fathers and sons.”
   I believe that my family is not only my parents who raised me, my
   little brother and my other relatives, but also my best friends. My
   great-aunt is my blood relative but she knows as much about me as the
   next person. My friend Caitlin can tell you anything you would ever
   want to know regarding me (slightly awkward) and we can practically
   read each other’s mind. I am not saying that my great-aunt is nothing
   (your great-aunt isn't a thing) but Caitlin is just as much a part of
   my family as my aunt. Family goes hand-in-hand with friendship. In
   order to have a family you need friendship. My family and I do not get
   along just because we are forced to live together. My family is my best
   friends and we get along because we genuinely love each other and want
   to be with each other.
   In today’s society most people consider family to be just blood
   relations but in reality it is (family aren't bonds. They are made up
   of bonds) the bonds you share with those you care for the most. Family
   is a completely necessary part of anyone’s life. Your family helps you
   through the tough times and provides the needed support to get you
   through life. Family cares about what happens to you, are always there
   for you, and above all, loves you.

   Well, if all families were like that, nobody would say "I hate my
   family"! [6]

   Besides, while Ler5018's point is that a family is not just made up of
   blood or marriage ties, Merriam-Webster's definition doesn't mention
   "blood" or "marriage" at all! Emotion: wink

   Hey thanks for your opinions!! I edited my my essay a little. Let me
   know what you think!!!

   My friend Caitlin can tell you anything you would ever want to know

   Caitlin is just as much a part as my aunt. Family goes hand-in-hand

   family and I do not get along just because we are forced to live

   Family does not have to live under one roof or under one head as
   suggested by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. By saying that everyone
   has to live under one roof you immediately dismiss all friends, aunts,
   uncles, cousins, and grandparents that do not live with you. Each
   individual house is going to have a person in charge, but that is just
   for the individual house. That person in charge is not the head of the
   entire family. My father does not control my cousins and my uncle does
   not control my brother and I. If you truly love and care for all your
   relatives and friends, then living in different houses under different
   heads will not change whether or not you are all family.

   Hi Ler,
   Just a couple of things:
   1. You need to have a definition that includes the common notion about
   blood ties before you attack it.
   2. Introduce your own definition after you have demolished the
   original.
   Just my two cents, again. Emotion: big smile

   While all this can be true of a family, it is not the only or the
   correct way that family can be defined. (Your criticism of Webster's
   definition or any common notion regarding the subject has to come here)
   Family is more accurately described as a group of people who might not
   be related by blood or marriage but who sincerely care and love each
   other. Family is there for you every step of the way and provides
   support you could never get anywhere else.

   all of that and is the love you share with your friends and relatives.
   One very common misconception (too soon. You haven't established that
   yet) about family is that its members have to be related by blood,
   marriage, or adoption. In truth, family is anyone you love and care
   about and who also feel the same way about you. Johann Schiller

   has to live under one roof you immediately dismiss all friends, aunts,
   uncles, cousins, and grandparents that do not live with you. (Your
   comments on the definition has to come before you establish your own)
   Each individual house is going to have a person in charge, but that is
   just for the individual house. That person in charge is not the head of
   the entire family. My father does not control my cousins and my uncle
   does not control my brother and I. If you truly love and care for all
   your relatives and friends, then living in different houses under
   different heads will not change whether or not you are all family. (The
   rest of the paragraph is merely reiterating what you've said earlier)
   In today’s society most people consider family to be just blood
   relations but in reality family is made of the bonds you share with
   those you care for the most. Family is a completely necessary part of
   anyone’s life. Your family helps you through the tough times and

   Students: Are you brave enough to let our tutors analyse your
   pronunciation?
   so after moving things around and changing some aspect of my essay I
   finished and this is my final draft. Thank you so much everyone for
   your help and for being truthful!!!
   Defining Family
   When most people think of the word family, mother, father, children,
   and relatives immediately come to mind. If you look up the word in the
   Oxford English dictionary you would read:

     fam·i·ly (făm'ə-lē, făm'lē) n. - the group of persons consisting of
     the parents and their children, whether actually living together or
     not; in wider sense, the unity formed by those who are nearly
     connected by blood or affinity.

   While all this can be true of a family, it is not the only or the
   correct way that family can be defined. Family is more accurately
   described as a group of people who might not be related by blood or
   marriage but who sincerely care and love each other. They are there for
   you every step of the way and provide support you could never get
   anywhere else.
   Since the beginning, families have been the building blocks of any
   society. Almost every aspect of our lives involves the term family. In
   our religion we are part of a “family” of believers. At Penn State we
   are part of one big “family” of students and faculty. One person unites
   our country as a “family” whom we all look towards for guidance. While
   these examples might be accepted by society today, it only describes
   family in broad terms. Family love is much deeper than all of that and
   is the love you share with your friends and relatives.
   One very common misconception about family, as seen in the Oxford
   definition, is that its members almost always have to be related by
   blood, marriage, or adoption. In truth, family is anyone you love and
   care about and who also feels the same way about you. German poet
   Johann Schiller described family perfectly when he said; “It is not
   flesh and blood but the heart which makes us fathers and sons.” I
   believe that my family is not only my parents, my little brother and my
   other relatives, but also my best friends. My great-aunt is my blood
   relative but she knows as much about me as the next person. For
   example, my friend Caitlin can tell you anything you would ever want to
   know concerning me and we can practically read each other’s mind. I am
   not saying that my great-aunt is not considered part of my family but
   Caitlin is just as much as my aunt.
   Family goes hand-in-hand with friendship. In order to have a family you
   need friendship. My family and I do not get along just because we are
   forced to live together. My family are my best friends and we get along
   because we genuinely love each other and want to be with each other.
   Every family is going to have its problems, but in the end no one can
   deny the love they have for each other.
   In today’s society most people consider family to be just blood
   relations but in reality family is made of the bonds you share with
   those you care for the most. Family is a completely necessary component
   of anyone’s life. Your family helps you through the tough times. They
   provide the needed support to get you through life. Family cares about
   what happens to you, are always there for you, and above all, they love
   you no matter what.

   If a "family" consists of members who care for each other, deleting
   from the meaning consanquinity, then how would you define "father"? If
   father are not genitors and only care takers, as you suggest, are you
   suggesting that every birth is a virgin birth? Gil Prost
