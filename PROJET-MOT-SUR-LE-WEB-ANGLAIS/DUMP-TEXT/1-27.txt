Blended family makes long-distance relationship work

   A long-distance marriage allows one blended family to feel whole, even
   though it is seen as unconventional.

   Brian Dennis and Jessalyn Coombe tied the knot at Globe Bistro on
   Toronto’s Danforth Ave. in May, but they have no immediate plans to
   move in together. Quite the opposite.

   Theirs is a long-distance marriage. Dennis lives in Toronto. His kids
   from a previous relationship, Danny, 15, and Jamie, 12, live with him
   half of the time. Coombe is based in Calgary where she shares 50-50
   custody of son, Henry, 7, with her former husband.

   The two met through working in the film and television industry and
   were together for five years before they married — an arrangement that
   initially raised eyebrows.

   “I would say about 100 per cent of people thought we were nuts until
   they were with us, and then it became really obvious that there was no
   other alternative and that we were going to find a way,” says Dennis.

   But their predicament — one that Coombe calls “a logistical problem,
   not a relationship problem” — may become a whole lot more common.

   Today’s divorcees are more likely than ever to share the parenting
   equally, says Nathalie Boutet, a collaborative family lawyer in Toronto
   — and that’s a good thing. The law on custody and access in Ontario
   starts “with a presumption that both parents should have equal time
   with the kids.” Studies have shown that it is best in most cases for
   both parents to have significant involvement in their children’s lives,
   she says. That means it’s now much less common than it was a generation
   ago for dads to see their kids only every second weekend.

   But it also means that couples such as Dennis and Coombe, whether
   separated by provinces or just a suburb or two, are tethered to the
   cities and towns where their child’s other parent lives. In fact,
   separation agreements often include a clause that establishes a
   geographic radius where each parent must remain living, says Boutet.

   So what’s a parent to do when they’ve fallen in love with someone who
   also has kids and doesn’t exactly live around the corner?

   Coombe says their situation is helped along by flexible work
   arrangements. Brian is a producer who works intensively on projects and
   then has periods of downtime. She has meetings that bring her to
   Toronto. They spend long weekends and vacations together as a family.

   “Part of it is helped by technology, actually, because when we’re apart
   we’re able to FaceTime or Skype, and actually see each other in real
   time, which helps us to connect,” she says.

   Both say they’d rather be in the same room every day if they could be,
   but there are some upsides to the tricky circumstances — particularly
   when it pertains to the kids’ adjustment.

   The relationships between the step-parents, stepchildren and both sets
   of siblings have developed slowly over time in a really unthreatening
   way, says Dennis. “It wasn’t like the moving van pulled up in the
   driveway and unloaded a bunch of stuff and I said, ‘I’d like you to
   meet your new stepmother.’ That shock never happened.”

   That’s a big upside, says Boutet. “It’s very complicated to blend
   families, so some people wait for the kids to be in university before
   they move in together to avoid conflicts or complications.”

   Meanwhile, the times Coombe and Dennis have which each other are
   quality time. “When you’re together every day and you’re thinking about
   the kids and lunches and meals, it can get lost — that focus on each
   other,” says Coombe.

   The book The New “I Do” — Reshaping Marriage for Skeptics, Realists and
   Rebels, which explores the various ways people are redefining the
   institution of marriage, certainly backs that up. One of the new models
   outlined is the “living alone together marriage,” says journalist Vicki
   Larson, who co-authored the book with therapist Susan Pease Gadoua.

   “Studies have shown that couples that choose this model are just as
   committed, feel just as secure as people who live together and they
   spend more quality time together,” says Larson. “They’re not sitting in
   front of their TV or on their computers kind of parallel playing.
   They’re actually engaging with each other when they see each other.”

   Still, Dennis says he and his wife do both dream of a more conventional
   family life.

   “While Jessalyn and I are working very hard at making our current
   family situation work, we view this as a space we’re moving through in
   order to get to the place where we can be together everyday.”
