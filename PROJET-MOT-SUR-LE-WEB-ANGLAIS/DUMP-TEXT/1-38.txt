   [gay-marriage-in-england.jpg] (REUTERS/Neil Hall)A rainbow flag flies
   with the Union flag above British Cabinet Offices, marking the first
   day Britain has allowed same sex marriages, in London March 29, 2014.
   Prime Minister David Cameron hailed Britain's first gay marriages on
   Saturday, saying marriage was not something that should be denied to
   anyone because of their sexuality.

   NEW YORK (Christian Examiner) – A new study from the Methodist Church
   in Britain is encouraging church workers and ministers to adopt a
   greater level of understanding and inclusion for new types of
   "families," including those composed of same-sex couples.

   "What does the word 'family' mean in the twenty-first century?" A
   summary of the study asks.

   "This is challenging, as what constitutes 'being a family' eludes being
   clearly defined. In contemporary society family is found in a variety
   of places and takes a number of different forms that go beyond blood
   relationships and relationships established by law. It is vital
   therefore for us to develop a clear understanding of the kinds of
   families taking part in family activities and the support offered to
   them by churches."

   The study, drawn from surveys, research and interviews, addresses
   families composed of heterosexual parents, parents with special needs
   children, grandparents raising grandchildren, single parents,
   multi-faith families, and "same sex couples with children."

   According to the full report, only a "few interviewees" believed the
   "concept of family was closely related to their theological
   understanding of the Bible and was one of father, mother and children
   living in the Christian faith, and for some people the Governments'
   introduction of same sex marriage was outside their definition of what
   constitutes family."
   “This is challenging, as what constitutes 'being a family' eludes being
   clearly defined. In contemporary society family is found in a variety
   of places and takes a number of different forms that go beyond blood
   relationships and relationships established by law. It is vital
   therefore for us to develop a clear understanding of the kinds of
   families taking part in family activities and the support offered to
   them by churches.”

   England (and Wales) opened the doors to same-sex marriage in 2014, but
   the Church of England – which still regards marriage as being only
   between one man and one woman – does not wed same-sex couples. The
   Methodist Church of Britain also has not authorized the marriage of
   same-sex couples, though it has softened its stance on the matter.

   On its website, the church claims: "Within our Church there is a
   spectrum of views on human sexuality. The Methodist Conference 2014
   reaffirmed the current Methodist Standing Orders which state our
   belief, 'that marriage is a gift of God and that it is God's intention
   that a marriage should be a life-long union in body, mind and spirit of
   one man and one woman.'

   "At the same time we have for nearly twenty years explicitly
   recognized, affirmed and celebrated the participation and ministry of
   lesbians and gay men, and been committed to a pilgrimage of faith to
   combat discrimination and give dignity and worth to people whatever
   their sexuality. The Conference in 2014 confirmed that there was no
   reason why Methodists may not enter legally formed same sex marriage
   (i.e. civil marriage) or form a civil partnership."

   The denomination is currently studying how to approach the issue of
   same-sex marriage.

   According to a news release accompanying the report, Gail Adcock,
   Families Ministries Development Officer in the Methodist Church, said
   the church's understanding of what families need in the modern context
   goes "beyond the concept of the nuclear family to encompass a diversity
   of relationships. Once we recognize this, we can adopt more inclusive
   language and respond more effectively to minister and support families
   in the contexts that they are in."

   Adcock said more support is needed for various "unique" families.

   "If we are to be effective family workers we can't just presume all
   families are the same. We must treat each family as unique and provide
   relevant support to them in the circumstances that they are in," Adcock
   said.
