Meaning of Family

   Michelle Blessing
   By Michelle Blessing Mental Health Professional
   family

   'Family' is a single word, with many different meanings. People have
   many ways of defining a family and what being a part of a family means
   to them. Families differ in terms of economic, cultural, social, and
   many other facets, but what every family has in common is that the
   people who call it a family are making clear that those people are
   important in some way to the person calling them his family.

Definition of Family

   The dictionary defines family in several ways. One definition is "a
   fundamental social group in society typically consisting of one or two
   parents and their children." While this definition is a good starting
   point, there are several modern family structures that are excluded by
   this definition, such as childless couples or other variations on the
   family unit. Another definition is "Two or more people who share goals
   and values, have long-term commitments to one another and reside
   usually in the same dwelling." This definition encompasses the vast
   majority of modern family units; for the purposes of this article, the
   second definition will be used.

Who Makes a Family?

   The traditional family consists of a father, mother and children. This
   is the family shown on television as the standard family. However, the
   21st century showcases a variety of family units, some very different
   from the standard of the 1950s. Today, children are also often raised
   in single parent homes, by grandparents or by homosexual parents. Some
   families opt to have no children, or cannot have children due to some
   medical or emotional barrier. The idea that parents and children make a
   family is a basic definition; however, in order to accurately
   acknowledge other family structures, a broader definition is necessary.
   In addition to a more universal family definition, there are also
   plenty of people who consider a group of friends to be family, and
   adults who consider pets as defining members of the family unit.

Friends as Family

   Many people consider friends to be as close or even closer than
   extended (or immediate) family. People who have lost close family
   members may create a family unit of friends with similar interests and
   goals to become replacements or enhancements to a lacking family
   structure. This type of family unit, while untraditional, can be just
   as close, if not closer, than a traditional structure. Friends are
   chosen by an individual; at times, these people may be more special or
   important than the family a person was born with. In addition, some
   people who have supportive families also have an extensive network of
   friends who they consider to be a second family or as additions to
   their blood or legal relatives.

Pets as Family

   Pets can also become members of a family unit. Pets add an element of
   responsibility to a family, particularly for children. For couples who
   cannot, or choose not to, have children, pets can be a replacement and
   be loved as dearly as children. Pets, such as dogs and cats, are cared
   for as additional family members by many people and are mourned as such
   as well when they pass away.

Redefining Family

   Rather than simply defining family by a dictionary definition, each
   individual should look to define a family by his own standards,
   enriching the dictionary's definition. You can have several families in
   your lifetime, even several families at once if you choose. Regardless
   of how you choose to define your family unit, whether it is traditional
   or unique, your definition is of the family unit that works for you. As
   the saying goes, "Family is what you make it." Whether made of blood
   relatives, friends, or pets, or a combination of these, your family can
   offer you the support you need to thrive.
