   As the Definition of ‘Family’ Evolves, Employers Increasingly Offer PTO
   for Adoption

   Employers are increasingly offering paid time off for adoptions,
   according to a new report from consulting group Mercer. The benefit is
   likely an attempt to meet the needs of a workforce in which the
   definition of “family” now includes same-sex parents, the firm said.

   While employees in the U.S. have access to 12 weeks’ unpaid leave for
   adoptions if they meet the Family and Medical Leave Act’s (FMLA)
   eligibility requirements, companies are beginning to provide more
   generous leave, Mercer said in its 2016 Global Parental Leave report.

   The report is based on findings from a study that surveyed companies
   around the globe. The survey revealed that in countries with generous
   mandated leave, such as those in Western Europe, employers merely rely
   on the applicable law. But in other countries, like the U.S., companies
   have “filled the void” with paid time off.

   Globally, 29% of employers said they provide adoption leave above
   relevant statutory requirements. Countries in the Americas rank higher
   at 33%. The practice is seen least often in Asia Pacific, with only 22%
   of employers offering more than statutory minimums.

The new ‘family’

   Providing leave for all parents is a way to accommodate increasingly
   varied families, Mercer said, noting that 87% of companies said they
   handle leave for same-sex couples in exactly the same way as they do
   for opposite-sex couples.

   “Adoption leave, like other leaves, helps employers accommodate more
   diverse family structures, which are now commonplace among their
   employee population,” said Ilya Bonic, senior partner and president of
   Mercer’s talent business, in a statement.

   And employers are taking these steps despite the lack of government
   mandates. While many countries require paid maternity leave, fewer
   require the same for fathers, same-sex couples, or adoptive parents.
   “Regardless, some companies, faced with the challenge to attract and
   retain key talent, have begun to offer paid or nonpaid time away in
   these less common—but growing—circumstances,” the report’s executive
   summary says.

   And using benefits like paid time off for adoption as a recruiting and
   retention tool may be working, Mercer said. In its 2015 employee
   survey, the firm found that 66% of workers said benefits make them feel
   appreciated by their company. Sixty-three percent said that benefits
   were one of the reasons they work for their current employer.
