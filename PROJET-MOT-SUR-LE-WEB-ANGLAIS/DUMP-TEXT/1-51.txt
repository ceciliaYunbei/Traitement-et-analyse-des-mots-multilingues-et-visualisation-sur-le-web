   Barely a week passes without a media report of the suffering or tragic
   death of a woman at the hands of a partner.

   Typically, these accounts focus on the individuals involved. While
   important, in isolation, such a focus can belie the fact intimate
   partner violence is a wider social problem, obscuring both the factors
   contributing to it and opportunities to prevent it.

   A study being launched today by Australia's National Research
   Organisation for Women's Safety confirms the serious impacts of
   intimate partner violence. The analysis, undertaken by the Australian
   Institute of Health and Welfare, provides estimates of the impact of
   intimate partner violence on women's health.

   Data from the Personal Safety Survey, Australia's most reliable
   violence prevalence survey, was used as a key input.

   Since the age of 15, one in four women in Australia have experienced at
   least one incident of violence by a partner. This includes violence
   perpetrated by a live-in partner as well as boyfriends, girlfriends or
   dates. This is based on a definition of violence, used by the Personal
   Safety Survey, which includes physical and sexual assault, as well as
   face-to-face threats the victim believed were likely and able to be
   carried out.

   When emotional abuse by a live-in partner is included, (defined as
   controlling behaviours aimed at causing fear or emotional harm), it is
   estimated one in three women have experienced violence or abuse by an
   intimate partner.

Serious impacts on women's health

   Drawing on Australian and international studies, the Australian
   Institute of Health and Welfare found an association between women
   experiencing partner violence and a wide range of health impacts.
   Particularly compelling evidence was found linking partner violence to:
     * anxiety
     * depression
     * suicide and self-inflicted injuries
     * alcohol use disorders
     * homicide and violence
     * early pregnancy loss.

   These factors were used in calculating the burden of disease of partner
   violence.

   The burden of disease is a calculation of the impact of particular
   diseases and risk factors on an entire population. It is a measure of
   both fatal and non-fatal health impacts, which take into account the
   severity and duration of health conditions.

   The study found partner violence was among the top ten risk factors
   contributing to disease burden among all adult women, regardless of
   whether partner violence was defined broadly (violence by both live-in
   and non-live-in partners, and emotional abuse by live-in partners) or
   narrowly (only physical and sexual violence in live-in relationships).

   Among women 18 to 44 years, it was the biggest single risk factor when
   violence in all intimate relationships was included, bigger than
   smoking, alcohol use or being overweight or obese. When considering
   only violence by live-in partners, in this age group, partner violence
   ranked second only to alcohol use.

   The study found there had been no change in the burden since 2003.

Burden even larger for Indigenous women

   Physical and sexual partner violence is the leading risk factor
   contributing to disease burden in Indigenous women aged 18 to 44 years.
   The rates of burden of physical and sexual violence in both cohabiting
   and non-cohabiting relationships were compared between Indigenous and
   non-Indigenous women. Rates for Indigenous women were:
     * 6.3 times greater among women 18-44 years; and
     * 5.3 times greater among women of all ages.

   This burden was the leading contributor to the gap in burden between
   Indigenous and non-Indigenous women aged 18 to 44; and the sixth
   largest contributor to the gap among women of all ages.

A preventable burden

   Front-line services, such as the police, women's refuges and
   counselling and support services play a vital role, reducing exposure
   to violence and its health consequences by helping women to secure
   safety, supporting their recovery, and holding men who use violence
   accountable. Recent inquiries in Victoria and Queensland show that
   although such services have improved, much more needs to be done.

   Another effective way to reduce the burden is to prevent "new cases" of
   partner violence, by tackling its underlying causes. These are
   increasingly well understood, along with the means to address them.

   Among these factors is inequality between men and women, an influence
   made particularly potent when coupled with poverty, social exclusion
   and other forms of discrimination.

   A sustained, coordinated approach is needed which extends beyond
   affected individuals, and engages a wide range of sectors – not just
   front-line services - to shift social, community and organisational
   norms, practices and policies known to increase the likelihood of
   violence. A similar approach, often referred to as a public health
   approach, has been used very successfully in Australia to tackle other
   prevalent risk factors such as tobacco use and road safety hazards.
