   Definition of infertility now includes healthy singletons

   Single men and women without any medical problems could soon have the
   right to start IVF treatment to become parents.

   The World Health Organisation (WHO) has taken a big step to give
   everyone ‘the right to reproduce’ by changing the definition of
   ‘infertility’.
   'She has no set hour to clock off and isn't rewarded with overtime or
   bonuses': Loving husband posts heartfelt dedication to his wife who is
   a stay-at-home mum Man writes touching tribute to his wife to remind
   her she’s more than a stay-at-home mum

   Currently, the term is used to describe people who have failed to
   become pregnant after 12 months of trying to conceive naturally,
   according to The Telegraph.

   But the new definition will now extend to heterosexual single men and
   women, and gay men and women who don’t have partners, but want
   to become parents.

   The redefined standard will be sent to health ministers next year,
   which is likely to place pressure on the NHS to change its policy on
   those eligible for IVF treatment.

   But the decision was branded ‘absurd nonsense’ by critics and raised
   concerns that couples with medical infertility could lose the chance to
   have children.

   100&#038;h=75] People think the ‘Refugee child’ in the picture is an
   ‘interpreter’

   Gareth Johnson MP, whose own children were born thanks to fertility
   treatment,  told the newspaper WHO is ‘trying to put IVF into a box
   that doesn’t fit’.

   ‘This definition runs the risk of undermining the work Nice (National
   Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and others have  done to
   ensure IVF treatment is made available for infertile couples when  you
   get definitions off the mark like this,’ he added.

What's wrong with surrogates and sperm donors?

   It’s illegal in the UK for someone to pay a surrogate to bear their
   child, and this has resulted in severe shortages of women wanting to be
   a surrogate.

   There is also a national shortage of sperm and egg donors.

   Fertility treatment is only funded for those proven infertile, so could
   open the doors for those who have failed to find a surrogate or donor.

   Metro.co.uk contacted NHS and WHO for comment.
