Definition of Family

   By Melissa Mayntz
   Family Family can be defined in many different ways.

   Family may seem like a simple concept, but there is no simple
   definition of family. In its most basic terms, a family is a group of
   individuals who share a legal or genetic bond, but for many people,
   family means much more, and even the simple idea of genetic bonds can
   be more complicated than it seems.
   [INS: :INS]

Basic Family Definition

   In the most basic definition, a group of people who share a legal bond
   or a blood bond is a family.
     * Legal Bonds: Families are legally bound through marriages,
       adoptions, and guardianships, including the rights, duties, and
       obligations of those legal contracts. Legal bonds can be changed,
       expanded, or dissolved to change the composition of a family.
     * Blood Bonds: Individuals who are directly related through a common
       ancestor are part of a family. This includes both close and distant
       relatives such as siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles,
       nieces, nephews, and cousins. Researching a family tree or
       genealogical records can reveal familial blood bonds.

   Despite the apparent simplicity of this definition of family, the idea
   of family goes far beyond just legal or blood relationships for many
   people.

Types of Families

   There are many different types of families, each of which is equally
   viable as a supportive, caring unit.
     * Nuclear Family: Also called a conjugal family, this is the parents
       and their children living in the same residence or sharing the
       closest bonds.
     * Extended Family: This type of family includes all relatives in
       close proximity, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.
       In a family household that is extended, these relatives typically
       live together and all share daily household duties. This type of
       family is also called a joint family or multigenerational family
       depending on which members are included.
     * Complex Family: This type of extended family has three or more
       adults plus their children. This type of family may be formed
       through divorce and remarriage, or it may be formed through
       polygamy in societies where that practice is acceptable. Some
       families may be complex even without formal legal bonds between the
       adults.
     * Step Family: This is a family where the adults have divorced and
       remarried, bringing children from other unions together to form a
       new nuclear family. The children may come from several different
       parents or be on one or both sides of the new union.
     * Traditional Family: This is a family unit defined in the classic
       sense as the father working outside the home to support the members
       financially, while the mother remains at home and tends to domestic
       duties and child-rearing. This strict definition of family is less
       and less common in modern society.
     * Adopted Family: This type of family shares legal bonds but not
       genetic ones. Two parents may adopt a child to whom they share no
       blood relationship, or one parent may adopt the child of the other
       parent. Adopted families can also be defined in an emotional or
       spiritual sense where no formal legal bonds are present.
     * Foster Family: A foster family includes one or more adult parent
       who serves as a temporary guardian for one or more children to whom
       they may or may not be biologically related. In time, more formal
       arrangements may be made and foster children can be legally
       adopted.

   Many families can be classified as more than one specific type, and
   every family has its unique characteristics that make it special and
   comforting to its members.

Defining Your Family

   While the direct legal and genetic relationships you share with others
   can help you create your definition of family, there is more to family
   relationships than these basic concepts. A true family provides its
   members with emotional and spiritual kinship through:
     * Shared values, beliefs, and traditions
     * Common experiences and activities
     * Unconditional, non-judgmental support

   In many ways, different individuals relate to groups of people who
   provide them with emotional and spiritual connection as family, even if
   they share no legal or genetic bonds. For example, a church "family"
   has spiritual connections and shared values, even though its members
   are not formally related. Similarly, a work family has common
   experiences and share activities in long-term relationships without
   formal bonds. College fraternities and sororities often share familial
   bonds through experiences and consider one another brothers and sisters
   without formal relationships. With social networking technology, many
   people are even creating online or virtual families of individuals who
   share their beliefs, hobbies, and values even if they have never met in
   person.

   The definition of family is constantly evolving, and every person can
   define family in a different way to encompass the relationships she
   shares with people in her life. Over time one's family will change as
   one's life changes and the importance of family values and rituals
   deepen. Every member who is truly family will help make it richer.
