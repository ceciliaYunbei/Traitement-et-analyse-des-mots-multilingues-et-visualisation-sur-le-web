The Changing American Family

   Few sociological metaphors have ever been as successful as that of the
   nuclear family, which entered the language in 1949 at the beginning of
   what turned out to be the baby boom -- another highly successful figure
   of speech. The phrase ''nuclear family,'' meaning a married man and
   woman living with their offspring, was introduced by the anthropologist
   George Murdock, who openly acknowledged the implicit metaphor. ''Among
   the majority of the peoples on earth,'' he wrote, ''nuclear families
   are combined, like atoms in a molecule, into larger aggregates.'' But
   he also noted that in our own society, the nuclear family was ''the
   type of family recognized to the exclusion of all others.''

   The cultural truth acknowledged in that last sentence is one of the
   reasons why the Census Bureau's new data on family structures in
   America are so interesting. For the past half-century, this country has
   tended to think of the state of the nuclear family as a leading moral
   indicator. Now, for the first time, fewer than a quarter of the
   households in this country are made up of nuclear families -- 23.5
   percent to be exact, down from 25.6 percent in 1990 and 45 percent in
   1960. Also, for the first time, the number of people living alone is
   greater than the number of nuclear families. Meanwhile, the number of
   unmarried couples nearly doubled in the past decade to 5.5 million,
   still vastly fewer than the 55 million married couples.

   It is certainly possible to read these figures as unwelcome deviations
   from a fundamental norm, as conservative groups like the Family
   Research Council do. But the dominance of the nuclear family in the
   1950's and 1960's was just as much an expression of prevailing economic
   and sociological forces as its lack of dominance is now. The broad
   social shifts underlying these data -- the prevalence of women working
   outside the home, the decline of agricultural households, the
   ever-growing mobility of Americans, the postponing of marriage and
   childbearing, the extension of life spans -- do not necessarily point
   toward a more fragile social structure, even though some changes, like
   the increase in the number of single women with children, are
   troubling. What they point to is the flexibility and the increasing
   complexity of American family arrangements.

   The ideological emphasis on the nuclear family in recent decades has
   caused us to forget that the nuclear family itself, especially in its
   suburban, Ozzie and Harriet form, is a reduction of what family has
   meant in most places at most times in human history. The American
   nuclear family has been notable, to borrow George Murdock's words, for
   not combining into larger aggregates, like extended families, but for
   sticking to itself.

   You only have to have grown up in a nuclear family to understand the
   good it can do. But even children who grew up in nuclear families have
   contributed to their decline as they have gone on in many cases to form
   non-nuclear families of their own. What the new census data underscore
   is an increasing awareness that the nuclear family is not the only kind
   of family or even the only healthy kind of family. In modern America no
   type of family can really be recognized to the exclusion of all others.
