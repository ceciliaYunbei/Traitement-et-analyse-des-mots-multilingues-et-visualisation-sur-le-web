New York's Highest Court Has Expanded the Definition of What it Means to Be a
Parent

Under New York law, parental rights have now become more inclusive

   For decades, American culture has defined a family as a relatively
   simple nuclear unit of mother, father and children. However, in recent
   years the definition of family has shifted as society has become more
   open to other configurations, like single-parent households and parents
   who happen to be the same sex. Now, New York's highest court has
   expanded the definition of what it means to be a parent to include
   someone who is neither biologically related to the child nor an
   adoptive parent.

       Children Into Museumgoers

   Tuesday’s ruling by the New York State Court of Appeals stemmed from a
   case between a gay couple over custody for their child. The two women,
   in the case known only as Brooke S.B. and Elizabeth A. C.C., had been
   romantic partners for years and decided to raise a child together. In
   2008, Elizabeth became pregnant through artificial insemination, and
   while Brooke never formally adopted the boy, she still gave him her
   last name. Things got legally tricky a few years later, when the two
   women ended their relationship and Elizabeth tried to cut off Brooke's
   contact to the child, Alan Feuer reports for The New York Times. Brooke
   sued for custody, but was turned down by a lower court because of her
   lack of a traditional connection to the boy.

   “The court clearly heard us,” Eric Wrubel, a lawyer who represented the
   child in the case, tells Feuer. “They clearly see that the bright lines
   of biology and adoption just don’t fit today with marriage equality.
   They understand that couples and families these days are not just mom
   and dad, and husband and wife.”

   By expanding the definition of a parent in regards to their rights, the
   court has introduced a greater flexibility in how it handles
   complicated custody battles. For example, a parent who never formally
   adopted a spouse’s child from an earlier marriage could now argue for
   visitation and custody rights, G. Clay Whittaker reports for Popular
   Science. At the same time, a man who raised a child but later found
   that he isn’t the biological father won’t necessarily have to face
   long, complicated court battles in order to secure custody over the
   child.

   New York isn’t the first state to make moves toward expanding the
   definition of parenthood, as Feuer points out, citing examples like
   Oklahoma and South Carolina.

   “We’ve seen this all over the country, even in states that might be
   called gay unfriendly,” Nancy Polikoff, a professor at the American
   University Washington College of Law, tells Feuer. “Many courts have
   simply said that this person looks like a parent and you cannot just
   eliminate them from the child’s life. To have New York, where there are
   so many same-sex couples, be an outlier was a problem. But this catches
   New York up.”

   The ruling does raise new questions about the criteria that now defines
   parenthood in New York state, as the court did not explicitly write any
   out. While the court acknowledged that these questions will likely have
   to be addressed in the future, for now the ruling ensures that children
   can still see their parents, regardless of whether or not they are
   biologically related.
