The notion of family life

   The United Nations broadly defines a family as "any combination of two
   or more persons who are bound together by ties of mutual consent, birth
   and/or adoption or placement and who, together, assume responsibility
   for, inter alia, the care and maintenance of group members, the
   addition of new members through procreation or adoption, the
   socialisation of children and the social control of members" (Proinsias
   de Rossa - Social Welfare Minister's speech, February 14, 1995; Dail
   Debates, Volume 449 - The United Nations and the Irish Steering
   Committee of 1994 concentrated on a broad definition of the family as
   the fundamental element of society).

   This definition is very broad and encompasses any sort of relationship
   where individuals assume the obligation to live together. This is done
   in order not to exclude anyone from forming part of the term "family".

   The term "family" is found in article 23 of the International Covenant
   on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 23(1) states that "the
   family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is
   entitled to protection by society and the state". Family is said to be
   natural and fundamental, yet, it does not state what constitutes a
   family.

   However, sub-article 2 of the same article adds that "the right of men
   and women of marriageable age to marry and to form a family shall be
   recognised". Although there is no direct definition, indirectly the
   covenant seems to indicate that a family is formed by a marriageable
   union of a man and a woman.

   Marriage and family are seen synonymous as well in article 10 of the
   International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
   (ICESCR). However, they still do not provide a strict definition of
   what a family is.

   Can a family be equated to family life or family environment? The
   concepts of family life can be found in the European Convention on
   Human Rights (ECHR) and family environment is found in the Convention
   on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the African Charter on the Rights
   and Welfare of the Child.

   The CRC in its preamble states that a child should "grow up in a family
   environment". However, both conventions and the African charter do not
   define what constitutes family life and family environment. Yet, case
   law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) seems to point to the
   notion that family life includes also de facto families. In the
   landmark judgment of Marcks vs Belgium (1979), the ECtHR declared that
   family life between an unmarried mother and her child is created by the
   fact of birth itself.

   Geraldine Van Bueren adds that "there is an automatic and immediate
   transformation of the biological bond into a legal one and this
   attracts the application of article 8 (of the ECHR)" (Child Rights in
   Europe, Council of Europe Publishing, 2007, 118).

   In Boughanemi vs France (1996), the ECtHR stated that, even though
   there is no cohabitation, the bond between a parent and his or her
   child, whether such child is born in or out of wedlock, still
   constitutes family life.

   The relationship between a parent and a child suffices as the
   fundamental constituent of family life.

   The ECtHR declared that the relationship between two adults and their
   daughter who lived together but couldn't marry, because at that time
   divorce was not allowed in Ireland, constitutes, for all intents and
   purposes, family life as stated in Johnston and Others vs Ireland
   (1986).

   Family life depends upon the existence of close personal ties.

   The ECHR extends its protection under article 8 (the right to respect
   one's private and family life) to unmarried parents even if such
   non-marital relationship has been terminated as stated in Sommerfield
   vs Germany (2003).

   Can relationships between children and grandparents also fall within
   the ambit of family life? In Price vs UK (1982), the ECtHR ruled that
   blood ties only are not enough to build family life between
   grandparents and grandchildren. In 2000, the ECtHR, in L vs Finland,
   made it known that the grandparental bond does not have the same
   significance as the bond parents have with their children.

   Neil Ferguson et al state that the existence of family life needs to be
   seen from the child's and parents' perspectives. And he adds that in
   order to benefit from article 8's family life the content and the
   nature of the grandparental relationship needs to be studied
   (Grandparenting In Divorced Families, Bristol, 2004, 74).

   In Cauchi vs Direttur tas-Sigurtà Soċjali (October 10, 2005), the Court
   of Appeal stated that the test to assess the term "family" under the
   Social Security Act is one defined by cohabitation. Therefore, two
   unmarried cohabitating persons are deemed to be a "family" under the
   Social Security Act even though under the Civil Code they cannot
   qualify.

   In a range of cases, the ECtHR stated that various factors may be
   decisive in deciding what amounts to family life such as whether the
   couple live together, the length of their relationship and whether they
   have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children or
   by any other means.

   It seems that the notion of family life is taken to embrace not only
   marriage-based relationships but also relationships which are de facto,
   that is, where parties are living together outside marriage as stated
   in the Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights 1994 Vol 37
   (The Hague, 1996, 259).
